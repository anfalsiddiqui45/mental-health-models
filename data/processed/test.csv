"Things I used to find fun just feel like a chore to do, and boring. I find it exhausting to even get of my seat. I have tried exercising, waking up earlier, eating healthily, meditation and so many other things but no matter what I do I just feel lethargic and even when I think about the future, I do not think Ill feel satisfied. Also, the career i want is to be a singer, but I have already tried and being a successful singer is almost impossible in this world. There is no other career i want other than being a successful singer, everything else is just un-fulfilling to me to the point that Id rather just end my life. I am starting to feel like giving up on being a singer, which means I do not want to live anymore as stupid and childish as it sounds. This is the only career I have ever wanted in my life, but its impossible. I have had a few jobs before but they made me feel like I was wasting my life and I am terrible with social interaction. Everything in my life just feels so boring and I used to have high hopes for my future and I used to be a happy person but that was like 5 years ago now. I do not know what to do Everything feels boring and the career i want seems impossible",1

"Anxiety and Weed Hi, looking for a bit of advice and experiences from r/anxiety here.

Around Christmas I started to develop some kind of anxiety disorder and had a lot of panic attacks. For most of my life I've always been a little anxious and tended to overthink, but these symptoms were just much worse. Up to this point I've also been smoking weed, but not excessively, mostly once a week. After developing said disorder, weed now increases my symptoms, despite it never doing something like this before and it mostly calming me down. Even when I had a greenout, I mainly suffered physical symptoms. 

In response to my symptoms I started with autogenic training, a lot of introspection about my fears and stopped smoking for about a month. With this I got the worst of it under control. Since then I've been smoking a few times with mixed results, sometimes I get more anxious and panicky, but on other occasions it also felt like a normal high. 

Right now I still have some lingering symptoms that can be better or worse, depending on the day, so I'll definitely quit weed until I can resolve this. My question now is, if any of you here have suffered something similar and were you eventually able to smoke without getting anxious again? I'll be honest, I quit enjoyed being high, so that would be quite the bummer, but certainly not the end of the world.

Thanks in advance!",2

No one cares though lol. I am going to overdose rn. I am just done trying. Nobody gives a fuck about me. I am not doing anything well. I am bad at everything I do. what is the point of living if I am useless. I just bother people and eventually people get tired of me being depressed and suicidal for years. They end up leaving. Well see yah world! cannot say Ill miss you I want to die so bad,1
"I wish I hadn't been born,, help I mean, it's as simple as that.
I'm tired of living like this. Tired of living in general, and everything it involves — interpersonal relationships, people, politics, economy, thinking, expectatives. All that crap makes me feel like shit and I wish I could turn it all off. 

However I don't want to die. That would hurt the people around me. That would hurt my mom. And my little sister. And, unlike other situations, I wouldn't be here to (at least try to) fix it.  They'd be left with the same nothingness that I feel, but worse cuz ofc death of a loved one is worse than just my own personal regrets. 

So I just wish I hadn't been born. That my mom had had a miscarriage — that would've hurt, yeah, but not for long —, or that I'd never been conceived, or something. I wish I was a blank space in the Universe. Something that had never existed. A hole or something like that.
They say energy can't be destructed and I wish it wasn't like that. I wish I could just disappear completely from existence and leave no trace, I wish people would just forget everything about me so I could die without it being a sin. 

Is there a way to stop feeling like this? Cuz the only way to stop existing is dying, and I've already said why I don't want to kms, exactly. Is there a way to avoid it? Can it get better?",1
Can you pass anxiety down to your children? I want children when I'm older but I'm scared I'll  pass my anxiety on to them. And that makes me feel guilty.  Will I pass it down to children?,2
"I have learned that, when things start to go wrong, most everyone will abandon me. it is happened more times than I can count. A school project? A relationship? A job? A sick parent? Any inconvenience whatsoever? My welfare does not come first or second, but last. I am tired of picking up the slack for other people.I have low self-esteem and that does not help. But I also genuinely want to help other people; I know how hard things can get and I want to help support other people how they need. I cannot do everything, nor can anyone, but I would just hoped for more.I care about myself a lot and want the best for myself so I am trying to focus more on that while looking for better friends.I do not intend to be selfish. It just hurts to feel unsupported by the people that are most important to me. This clearly has not been working for me and I need to change something about it. When Things Go Wrong",1

I am dumb, I am so fucking stupid its not even funny. I am so fucking fucked i just want to lynch myself. i do not want to be here, fuck all of you, i just want to find someone my age attractive. i am so tired of having a bf 7yrs older than me when I am only 16, i feel fucking disgusting about it but hes the only person I have met in over a year that makes me feel anything. i think my ex really messed me up. why do men do that, think they can bang you whenever they want just because you are they are girlfriend. honestly i want to kill my ex, i hope everything he did to me happens to him &amp; i hope he rots in a tin fucking can for weeks, i know it would not make things better but so what, LMAO funny shit eh. i do not want to be alive. i do not want to be alive. 6 miserable years not a day without telling myself i should end my life. not a fucking day free from it. i am going fucking insane its day after day after fucking day wishing something would change &amp; it does not. it does not get better. it will not get better i am tired do not take me seriously",1

"Edit 2: This thread got so much more attention than I could have imagined, there's been so many people offering advice and sharing their life experiences.

I think I still have a long way to go, maybe these thought's will never disappear but today has been the best day since they began and it's in a large part due to the people who spoke on this thread.

"so, this might be a little long. sorry about that in advance anyway.like the title said I have no idea what I am doing with my life, not trying to feel sorry for myself by posting this or anything I just do not know what to do anymore. I had a very complicated childhood, my parents never let me get an education. (and by that I mean not at all, I never did any school work, or even went to school at all when I was a kid/teen.)my spelling is almost nonexistent and no matter how hard I try I cannot seem to improve it (using a mix of autocorrect/google translate to write this out) and my math is awful, but I did manage to teach myself to read quite well though.I was not allowed to talk to other kids growing up and so I had no friends growing up and was not allowed to leave the house at all, only sometimes to go shopping with my dad or mom. and I went out even less after my father killed himself when I was 8.the first time I talked to someone/went outside by myself was when I was 16 and it was to get milk and other stuff because my mom just got too lazy and she could not be bothered anymore I suppose. as you probably guessed I have extreme social anxiety and can barely talk to other people even till this day.this might sound awful and I feel awful for saying this, but covid is probably the best thing to ever happen to me I was able to move out with one of my sisters because of government benefits, because of this I was able to look inward and able to see how badly I was treated by my family and to see that I might have a lot of mental problems because of this.I do not know how I thought my home life was normal, but I had my mom calling me useless because I was unable to get a job and pay her rent, and most of my siblings treated me like dirt acting grossed out just from seeing me, and some of them even used to tell me that: I should kill myself because no one would miss me anyway"".the only people in my family I am close with are my two little sisters and my older brother though he cut everyone in our family off including me because his wife does not like any of us which hit me hard.my family has pretty much fallen apart a surprise to anyone reading this I am sure haha.so that brings us to today I am 23 years old have no education, do not have any friends, I cannot get a job, and I Might be homeless soon.I am seeing a psychologist soon. I do not think it will help me much honestly. I wake up every day scared of being homeless I cannot relax anymore, I do not enjoy anything in life anymore. for anyone who is worried I do not think I am suicidal, but I am honestly finding it hard to find a reason to live anymore.to anyone who made it to the end of this probably very badly spelled post, Thank you. I feel like I am floating through life, and I do not know what to do anymore.",1
i feel really lazy it wa embarrassing for me to even have to ask for something but it s been over week and everything got worse idk if i feel any different think now i just have even le energy to do anything my room is disgusting my essay are overdue and i haven t been outside in too long i m way too embarrassed to ever say this to my gp no word of encouragement on reddit will help im afraid but idk what to do anymore it s getting worse and every day i m just procrastinating i m scared of everything catching up but somehow can t do anything about it never felt like this before i almost want to hide away and die not literally just don t know how to overcome this there s not a lot and i have a massive incentive,1

"You see inspirational posts all day and they are bull. This one especially, ""give your mind a break, do not worry about working or socializing 24/7"". To everyone saying this you do realize that we live in a system that requires unhealthy lacks of mental health? Plus the people posting these usually look down on or hate on people they do not see as ""successful"" or get upset when someone cannot make it to a social event. Everyone around me is telling me to focus on my health but these are the same people telling me every day how much is at stake if I do not succeed or beg me to hangout all the time. They make fun of mutual friends who ""are in a bad place"". The hypocrisy makes me even more sick on a daily basis. Fakeness of ""Give your mental health a break""",1
"For such a long time I have lived in that small space of my basement appartement. It was one small room and a even smaller bathroom.The last 5 years of these 19 were the worst. I had night terrors about beeing burried alife. The appartement made me feel weird after some time and my life got to the bad side once I started living in the basement. I had no more drive doing anything, there was no energy or believe in myself. Just watching the internet. I barely had 2 friends that i saw maybe once or twice a month.But after one night terror where i dreamed I was stuck in my appartement for the rest of my life (I literally saw the windows dissapear and a stone wall behind them) I jumped out of bed and ran out of the door and stood naked in the staircase with my heart racing. I slowly realised it was a dream but there i stood there naked and thankfully no one saw me. So i just went back to bed. But the night terrors kept on comming. After a while i seemed to loose the skill of keeping track of the night terrors.I just barely woke up letting out a loud scream every night for a few month and went back to bed sometimes without realising what happened the next morning. But truth is no one could hear me screem down there in that ""hole"".This made me realise that I am in a prison and need to get out. I need to change something. I did therapy and after such a long time of having no job just sitting in front of my screen all day in the basement i finally found a job. And the appartement that i now live is on the top floor.What is so weird now i can finally see the world! I never saw humans in my basement appartement and now i can see people walk on the street! I can see the rain falling! I can see people sit together talking with each other. I was so isolated for such a long time i thought it is normal to be alone and just browing the web.I think now that I am 36 years old, i want to make more of my life now after so many years spent in isolation. I want to move now maybe ever 5 years to see more of the world. I have a huge list of things i want to do now and i hope i can.You guys would not believe how fucking bright this appartement is where i life now. I have a nice balcony this is such a great thing to have. And the appartement i am now in has huge glass walls behind the balcony so every morning the sun is shining into the whole appartement. I must say the first mornings i thought to myself ""wtf its 5 am why is the sun soo bright??"" because in my basement appartement i never really saw the sun.I do not want to say basement appartements are bad but its the time spend below earth that can drive you crazy. Or me at least. Anyway I am so relieved that I made it. After 19 years living in a small basmement appartement i finally found a job and was able to move up!",1
"I feel like I'm going to go insane. I can't stop crying or wanting to pull my hair out or screaming. I can't stop shaking. I'm on medications for anxiety and they help some but not much and not often... Ultimately, I know I'm not me anymore.",3
"Ever since I was a little kid I grew up thinking I was inferior. The culture I was raised in was very colorist and restrictive, and the fact my skin tone was on the darker side made me subject to all kinds of insecurity. I was indirectly programmed to believe I was not enough and that I was unattractive. My family emigrated and I grew up in a country in which I am a minority. This made it even worse. I already expected people to treat me like shit and I would not speak to people because I was almost certain that they would want nothing to do with me. Now when I look in the mirror or when somebody takes a picture of me, my entire mood/day is ruined. I feel sick and disgusted to the core. Society is incredibly hard wired to evaluate the worth of a person just by the way they look, which I guess then makes me a nobody. I have boundless, unconditional self hatred. I could not hate any entity in the universe more than I despise myself. My self hatred just continues to perpetuate itself. Everywhere I go I see beautiful ,perfect faces. Every time I check my phone. Every time I turn on the TV. Every time I go for a walk outside. I feel so disgusting and hideous compared to everybody else. I am unable to see myself in any other way. I feel as if I am undeserving of love, affection, friendship. I deserve nothing. When I see a pretty girl, I do not think about how pretty she is, but how disgusted she would be to know that a guy like me found her attractive. I isolate myself from friends and family. I sometimes ask my friends why they even want to speak to me. I want to be attractive. I want to feel confident. I want to be loved. I want to have a family and raise children and be successful. I want to be somebody else, somebody who is not me. I just want to be happy. And I never will be. Self esteem is destroying my life (rant)",1

"Life is depressing I’m pretty sure this has been posted a million times here before. But I just feel like I’m done with life and I’m only 24, and no matter what it is I’m doing I’m either feeling anxious or depressed as they do come hand in hand. I don’t enjoy hanging out with family or friends, I’d rather be alone but when I’m alone and at home I feel useless and depressed. I’m too tired to even explain in detail but I’m sure you all know this feeling.

"Spent the past few weeks to meet all my friends and the family members who would still talk to me, since I thought it would be nice to see them one last time.&amp;#x200B;I have fucked up everything I could in my life. I got a degree in a field in which I am unable to properly work in and I no longer see any point in doing it. I have become a useless piece of shit, unable to get out of bed in the morning.&amp;#x200B;I unconciously sabotaged all of my relationships and ended up hurting all of my exes. I feel extremely lonely, but also I drink excessively on almost any social occasion, as it is the only way for me to stand most of the people around me. Most of my friends are metaphorically drifting away from me, which is, of course, good for them, since I have never really been a good friend and also they will have it easier for when I finally leave this world.&amp;#x200B;I no longer find any joy in anything. I used to have lots of hobbies, was considered an extremely talented kid, I had dozens of great opportunities, I had some great plans, I wanted to see the world, be happy, do some good, but in the end I have failed in basically everything I could and I just want to leave this fucking mess.

"Long story short, I have just stopped taking a pretty strong narcotic that I have taken almost daily for about a year. The withdrawal is very similar to opiate withdrawal, and because of it (I think) my depression has come roaring back very intensely. I am experiencing pretty extreme waves of almost frantic sadness and panic. I am not quite sure what to do. I have a job/house/relationship that are very important to me. And without going into details, those things very well may all be gone at some point in the future, and I feel like I have been living on borrowed time for the last number of years. Now that everything is flooding back into my head, I am not sure Ill come out okay at the end of it. Has anybody been in this position? Do I just ride it out and hope for the best? Do I need more medication than I already take? Think I might need some help, but do not know if this is the right place",1

"To make a long story short; I grew up in an Arab household. Crying or expressing emotions as a man was not appropriate and would be seen as a weakness and emasculate you. I picked up on that quiet early as I once cried as a kid around 7 ish years and got in trouble for doing that. Ever since I have never cried in front of my family. Sadly it caught on fast and I cannot cry even when I am extremely sad. I am often so depressed and just want to cry it all out and feel better afterwards, but I just cannot cry. And to add on top of that, I am in a long committed relationship and my girlfriend [F22] easily cry when she is upset or sad which makes it harder for her to understand me being sad or depressed as I do not express it by crying Anyone else not able to cry and how to get those feelings out??td;lr Depressed but can never cry. Growing up I always got shamed for showing emotions and crying which made me eliminate those. [M23] Anyone not able to cry? Servere depression through 7+ years.",1
"Hit my head about 2 months ago, have vertigo and memory issues Hi guys. I hit the side of my head very hard on the corner of a table in late November. I didn’t lose consciousness and there was no blood. I also didn’t have vomiting or nausea.

Everything is made WAY WORSE by caffeine. Also sometimes i will have a headache or dull pain in the area that i hit my head but it’s about once a week so not often. I have been to two doctors who have examined me and said I’m fine but I’ve had no CT scan or MRI. I am so scared i have a hematoma or something!!

"Up and down So, my health anxiety focuses on getting pregnant: I’m terrified of it, don’t ever want to be (I’m 20) and no doctor will tie my tubes. I thought either my contraceptive implant was broken, i would do pregnancy tests and not trust the result or go digging through the bin for them, I didn’t trust a blood test, I thought every twinge in my body was a symptom. I thought I saw signs everywhere telling me I was pregnant.

Then, last week, after 3 CBT sessions, upping my anti depressants and travelling home to see my parents for the first time in 4 weeks, I had the first ‘good’ week since September. No tests, no doctor visits, plenty of exercise, could snap myself out of any dangerous thought patterns. No googling! I was so happy and proud. I even had sex for the first time in 4 months with my boyfriend. 

Then, on Saturday morning, my boyfriend accidentally grabbed my arm implant. Since then, I feel like I’ve spiralled back of control after just one week of happiness. I’ve resisted doing a test so far, but I swear my implant is broken even after seeing a nurse, I’m symptom spotting, googling, crying etc. My techniques to cope aren’t working. I go from feeling scared and upset to angry with myself and the world.

I was just wondering, how do people cope with these type of set backs? How do you pull yourself up again? At the minute I just feel sad and depressed and angry. Fuck you, health anxiety.",2

I had a mini win ! Hello everyone I hope you’re okay. I was just playing FIFA and boom a big palpitation hit I started to panic felt lightheaded because I was holding my breath because I was so tense and then calmed down. I have had my heart checked 7 times 2 of which are private best testing ones and it’s perfect so I know it’s not going to harm me but still catches me off guard I think it’s more of the fact I was leaning forward that it felt harder and the fact I was breathing in lol. Anyway ! I was laying in bed thinking I need to just once and for all get over all of the symptoms that are making me scared of being I’ll and dying. How can I do that ???? GET OVER MY FEAR OF DYING now I’m not saying I’m perfectly fine with death because I am not but I just thought to myself I can’t stop death and I just need to accept it. If there isn’t a god I won’t know about dying after if there is a God I could go to heaven which is great and who knows I could reincarnate and live life again. We don’t know so it’s the anxiety of not knowing which scares me and leaving my family behind. Like I say I’m a healthy 22 year old male with NO health conditions death can happen at anytime and could happen the next minute but for my age and health it is unlikely but never zero. Now I’m religious and I am sort of anxious in my mind that God is trying to get me to accept death so I can die soon lol but I don’t wanna die soon that’s why I’m scared off. That’s just my anxious mind thinking right ? I guess the positive way of looking at it is that God is getting me to get over my fear of death so I can live the LONG HAPPY HEALTHY LIFE that he put out for me. Can anyone help me accept death even more ?,2
"Don’t know what to do I may cuss I’m sorry if I do that’s what the nsfw is for. Anyway so I’ve had a job as a cook for the last year about. They overlooked the.

They still hired me and I was told many times in their hardest worker. Anyway. Along with that my moms sick she has a few terminal illnesses. And I don’t have any friends anymore cause I got fired. No one has even asked how I’m doing of those ex coworkers. I have a job interview today. But I can’t get out of this funk like I cannot get out of my own head that this is just what I deserve for the things I did when I was younger. I just deserve to suffer and somewhat loath myself. I kicked a drug habit and moved and yea being sober is actually awesome. But, being lonely like so lonely that I got love money scammed out of most of my savings.

"Son has weird bump on shoulder I'm waiting for new insurance to come through before I can take him to the doctor, I was hoping to be able to post a picture of it but I guess this sub won't let me. My 8yr old has what looks like a blood blister on his shoulder. It's a red bubble, not purple like a blood blister you get when smashing your finger or anything. It looks nothing like any picture I've looked up. Just a bright red bubble and it's been growing the past 3 weeks or so, it was very tiny before and he had picked at it thinking it was a scab, it bled and bled, but that was when it was the size of a large freckle maybe, now it's the size if a mole.

My mom says I am not ugly, but no one at school has ever felt attracted to me, I never came out at school, and I do not even know if there are other gay guys there, so it is no wonder no guy ever liked me; but i really think there is got to be a reason for no girls ever liking me, not even a single girl was interested in me in all those years, i studied in that school for 15 years, i had been classmates with the same people for 8 years, and no one showed any interest, that honestly makes me sad...and makes me doubt my mom's words)]*Side note, i posted some pics in other subs and this person saw them, they are in my profile, keep in mind it is NSFW, so if you dislike it, do not see please, continuing...*[(I think it is really obvious that I am very insecure about the size of my penis, if i had to explain it properly,( well you already saw it) i dislike it is size, and it is color, I am fine with the shape, I am fine with the glands, I am fine with the curve, I am fine with the foreskin, but I am unhappy about the size and the color, i wish it was bigger, like 6 to 7 inches, and that the color was more resembling pink.I know it is no use worrying about those two things, i know it is something out of my control, but you have no idea how much it frustrates me, i feel so ugly, so unattractive, and unlikeable.The only hope i have left is working out and loosing all this extra weight, but even if i did, 5.5 inches long, and 4.7 inches thick is all i can truly be, 5.5 is my bone pressed length, and even tho people say it is averages, honestly it is not enough; i was fine with not being as tall as i wanted, i was fine with not being as smart as i thought i was, i was fine with not being so lucky with love, i was fine with not having a boyfriend before, i was fine with so many things, i was willing to accept so many bad things i have, because, after all, no one is perfect, we all pretty much HAVE to have something not so beautiful, but why do I have to be so poorly endowed, it is so frustrating! If I am unhappy with my weight, i can change it, if I am unhappy with my height, well, I am 174cm, and even though that is not very tall, it is not very short either, not only that, but it kind of helps me feel somewhat cute...well it would help me feel cute, if i did not already feel so ugly.You know, I am not even into being some sort of playboy, and I am not into having one night stands, or fooling around having casual sex, sex has a deep meaning for me, i just want to find my true love, i just want to find someone special who loves me and who i love, I am so willing to work hard to earn someone is love, to be special to someone, but honestly, i do not feel handsome enough to be with someone, i would like to feel handsome, and sexy and beautiful for him, but when i see myself, i do not see someone attractive, handsome, sexy nor beautiful, and it depresses me so much just thinking about making someone settle for less, settle for me, i wish I could be good enough, so that being with me does not feel like he is doing me a favor, i want to be someone my loved one not only loves, but also truly desires to be with, i do not want to feel like love blinds him in order to be with me.)]*that is the end of the message i wrote to the other person*I was chatting with other people, but things did not end up very well, i ended up feeling really sad, despite their kinds words,.so I am writing here, hopefully people here do not struggle with their sexuality, that is something i would not wish to anyone, but maybe i could be understood, since other people did not understand...

"Long story short, I have depression, and a very low self esteem. Therefore, everyday I think people do not like, but just tolerate me. There are only a few people, I would open up to, my ""closest friends"" are not one of them, because they would probably tell me something like ""it is going to be okay"" or ""it is not that bad"" or just crack a stupid joke.

"Swallowing air, mostly when laying on my back Since the start of this year I‘ve had really weird symptoms. It started when i suddenly noticed some faint clicking noises at the back of my throat. I got very scared because i was high (on weed) at that time and since weed does trigger paranoia I was sent into a full-blown panic attack. While being in a panic attack I first started swallowing a lot of air due to an anxiety reflex. After sobering up, I was back to normal. But stupid me thought it was okay to smoke weed again so I had my next panic attack, shaking and just feeling and hearing all the air move in my stomach and abdomen. At this point i quit smoking. Yet after that incident i noticed, that whenever I laid down on my back and swallowed(mostly the normal spit-swallow reflex) i could hear and feel tiny air bubbles travel down my esophagus. this happens absolutely subconsciously, I cannot control it. I’ve also noticed how sometimes my ears and my throat hurts. Now I‘ve become extremely aware of how i breathe, how I swallow and  when I feel or hear something weird in my body and this led to searching the internet for various reasons as to why this may be happening to me. I‘ve thought about hiatus hernia(the conditions where the diaphragm pushes into the stomach or the esophagus), GERD(but I‘ve never noticed any acidic reflux), and so on... It‘s gotten so bad that some nights I can‘t even sleep because I‘m having such bad anxiety about my symptoms... I‘ve gone to three different doctors, the first one completely ignored my symptoms and just said the bloating comes from an intestinal infection(or something like that idk), the second one sent me to a therapist to whom I‘ll go to in march and the third one didn‘t find anything wtong with me, just like the first one. It‘s extremely hard for me to live with this condition, because wherever I searched, I‘ve found absolutely nothing that actually led me to an illness or such. I‘m using simeticon to relieve the bloating, because I‘m not able to burp all of the air out. But I may add that I do burp a lot because of the subconcious air swallowing which sometimes happens eventhough I‘m not laying down. When I lay down on my back though, it happens almost constant. I was wondering if anyone here has or had something similar to this? :(",2

"I need help with quitting job This week, I started a construction job I wasn't 100% sure about.
My coworkers and supervisors are nice people but the job isn't what I expected.

Some tasks were understated when I applied for the job and in the interview but the tasks actually require a significant amount of my daily effort. 

Also I'm underpaid relative to what I was paid in my previous job as well as no paid break. However,  the job is 30 minutes from my house so cheaper public transportation. 

So because they're nice to me, patient, and welcoming I feel very uncomfortable telling them I'll quit even though the job contract says neither party has to give notice. 


Also, I've always been an agency worker and the idea of having to give 2-3 weeks notice provides endless anxiety. In an agency job I could just phone or text and say I won't return the next day.

"Long story short, I am working with a psychologist to finally get to the root of 25ish years of moderate depression. it is hard to explain everything through the trauma I remember having suffered, mostly body dysmorphia and being a social outcast. There are some other things that potentially point towards sexual abuse at a young age. I cannot remember a thing and there are no risk factors for abuse in my very loving family, though there was some risk exposure to someone outside my family. Since working with my great psych i have started to feel occasional feelings after decades of emotional repression I am also starting to be a lot more aware of dreams that often involve me violently defending myself, though contain no sexual content. The dreams lately have been really rough, it is like even when I sleep I am not resting. it is just very disorienting not knowing if anything happened or if it did what it was. I am also worried I am reaching for an explanation of my depression that goes beyond what I already know (a feeling like what I was subjected to does not justify the level of depression I have suffered). It would be helpful to know what someone is experience was like uncovering fully repressed trauma of any kind. The good news is that I never tried to kill myself even after years of strong ideation (though came close to accidental death a few times doing high risk sports and jobs). I have managed to keep my health and avoid the very alluring pull of drinking and drugs. I have a wonderful partner, two amazing dogs, a great family, and good career, and some wonderful friends. I can even afford some treatment. I know lots of folks here have very difficult life circumstances that exacerbate their depression and I really feel for them. It is quite disorienting when you basically have everything going your way and still feel like shit though. Thanks! What was your experience uncovering and processing repressed trauma?",1

"I convinced myself that I have esophageal cancer. So I am 22 years old without any known digestive issues like GERD or anything. However for a couple of weeks now my stomach hurts like hell everytime I swallow something, like a cramp when the food is passing into it.

The last few month have probably been the most stressfull of my life so I had a lot of acid reflux issues which in turn can lead to only one logical conclusion that it hurts because my esophageal cancer is blocking most of the pipes and that I am going to die (/s).

The symptoms have gotten better over the last week now while I had vacation and only swallowing large portions causes the pain or when there is a lot of sauce on it. But that is a state I reached a few weeks back and it eventually retuned.

Anyone have some input here, because I know how much of a hassle it would be to get my doc to order a gastroscopy. So far he only gave me these acid absorbing pills or something like that but I am not sure that they helped all that much.

"I opened up to my friend and talked to my therapist.They both asked me what kind of thing i needed for them to help. They asked me if i just needed someone to listen, to give advice, to distract, etc... And honestly i had no idea what to say. Idk what i need or want.If someone asked you what you needed, what did you say or what did someone do that you did not expect but found helpful?

"Having huge anxiety about my second emergency dentist appointment tomotrow I scheduled an emergency tooth extraction appointment last Saturday with my dentist who I haven't been able to go to in over a year due to lack of insurance/unemployment. My partner went with me as support and also because I can't drive. The dentist receptionist lectured me for not coming in for over a year, for scheduling an emergency extraction on a Saturday afternoon, and then said they wouldn't be able to extract it that day because they ""needed to see if the tooth could be saved"" despite me saying I can't afford any other option like a root canal. They also, despite me putting my preferred name in their site portal when I first started seeing them, keep misgendering and deadnaming me even though I told them last time that I prefer my preferred name and go by he/him (I am a grown ass medically but not surgically transitioned trans man). My partner, who also goes to this dentist but has had only good experiences with them, was apparently disgusted with how the receptionists treated me this time and now refuses to go back to them for their visits. But I paid $100 ahead of time for this tooth extraction tomorrow (because the receptionists basically forced me into it by showing me all the other pricing options without insurance) so I have to go back to them before I can move to a new dentist office. My partner is working tomorrow and can't go with me, so I'm basically dreading having to hear my deadname and being misgendered and lectured and all that bullshit all over again but on my own this time. Like, it's stressing me out to the point of almost crying. I don't usually get this worked up over being misgendered because like, I'm kinda fat and my facial hair is scraggly so I get a lot of misgendering from customers whenever I'm working retail jobs, but something about them *knowing* my preferred name and having been *told* about it before but choosing to ignore it is just...

I really would rather die then be alone and she fr was my only actual friend and idk how I can keep going without her.

"Hello, my name is Lucas, I have been dealing with depression for quite a few years now, I am 23 turning 24 in september. I feel like my life is just going further and further down hill, recently its been a 90 downward fall. I am heavily invested in computers and i love playing games, sometimes it feels like my pc is the ONLY thing i have left in this world, also because I am able to live in another reality for as long as my eyes are locked on to this screen. I do not feel like going outside, i barely speak back when spoken to (that is my own choice, for some reason.)My mother has a rare heart condition called ""Alcapa"". She has had 6 heart attacks and I have been a witness to multiple heart attacks she is had... it is the freakiest/scariest thing I have ever seen, i truly believe witnessing your own mothers quote on quote death, multiple times, fucks with you hardcore. Its a constant thought. I did not go to school for almost a year after it happened.. And that set me way back in school, so when i came back i knew nothing and i felt stupid. So i ended up being the ""funny/stupid"" guy in class, making jokes at the teachers and being sent to the principals office many maaaaany times. I never got good grades and that shit is hurting me so much right now, not being able to get a ""decent"" job.A few years after it was discovered that my mother had ""Alcapa"" my dad left us all to start a new family, at 48. Since i was the oldest at the time, i took on a kind of a ""father role"" at 16 years old. I have tried reaching out, but he does not really care. So I have stopped reaching out and making myself look stupid, i will not ever lay my eyes upon that vile human being again.When i was 20, i went to help one of my grandfathers friends paint he is house. We had a few beers at dinner and i decided to sleep there for the night, in the guest room. I woke up early in the morning and this guy was sitting on the side of my bed and had he is hand in my boxers. I freaked out, called my mother and my little brother. We called the cops and took him to court. I cannot begin to explain to you, how this ruins the way you look at yourself. You feel de-humanized and it feels like your masculinity is taken away from you aswell as all of your dignity. (I am heterosexual).After that happened i could barely look myself in the eyes when i stood in front of a mirror (i still barely cannot). I used to be muscular, like.. VERY. But it is all gone, i look like sticks now. My cheeks are inflated, and i look like a skeleton. When i look at myself i see a disgusting 23 year old who is 167 centimeters, still looks like a kid and cannot grow a beard. I cannot even go to the store and buy cigarettes without someone who is obviously younger then me asking for ID.I had a job 5 months ago. I made good money and it made me happy for a month, my first pay was amazing. But after that the job turned dull and extremely difficult and hard, they did not have appropiate equipment for carrying heavy stuff, we broke rules to almost break our own backs. I came home with pain in my back everyday and yellow and blue marks all over my arms. i had the job for about 3 months and then i got fired, because my ""boss"" told me i was not working hard enough. It made me snap and i said stuff i should not have, but whatever. I am happy I am done with that work, but it really shocked me that people look at me like I am not doing anything, when i really am putting in as much hard work as i can.I owe companies money at 23. I have taken small loans that have evolved into large amounts now.I have had a feeling my life would be short, ever since i was 14-15 years old, i do not know how to deal with this. The thought of suicide has crossed my mind over 1000 times, but i do not have the guts to go through with something like that. that is why I have fallen closer to the natural ""death"" side of things. I barely eat anything anymore, like, maybe a banana or something a day, because the pain in my stomach is too much sometimes and I have started smoking alot more cigarettes, just ""because"".I want help, but i will not ask for it. I have quit over 13 cigarettes on my own arm, it hurts and i do not like it, but i hope some day someone will notice my burn marks and ask what is wrong. I probably will not tell them what is wrong and I have been thinking about it alot. I feel like I am doing it for attention and I am NOT an attention seeker useually. I useually love just being overlooked. I am so confused! I want this off my chest.. Thanks.",1

"So an old friend invited me to his farewell party, I normally do not get invites like this but he was going away to another country, to be honest we were never that close because we went to different Universities but I get along well with him. It was a dinner party and there were about 12 people there most were female friends of his girlfriend and like 3 guys, the whole night I felt so zoned out, I felt horrible that I was not being friendly or talking to the others but I felt so faded, the alcohol made it even worse. One of the guys remarked how I barely talked to anyone the whole night, I felt crushed, I gave the usual a xcuse of I am tired but it was difficult not to leave right away. I was the first to leave it felt like I was giving up officially, I came home and cried.. yeah a 22yr old dude cried after a party, I feel like I am just a loser and no matter how much I force myself I will always be a loser, I give up even trying anymore I am tired of it.

As a student I have always tried to get the best grades possible with that i was not getting recognition from my family but was still determined to aim higher the year later i started high school with a 93 average and ended with 98 average totaling it up to 96.3. I have always thought that when i get these grades i would get a good job or congratulations from my parents but i was fully depressed when i told them about my final term grade and did not even get a good job or atta-boy which really affected me negatively and i was so sad that i had to confront my mother about this and we started crying and she said she would do better and thankfully it worked but it still lies in the back of my head wether or not if i had said this when my final grades are up she would appreciate or was my confrontation a wake up call to start appreciating me. Even my siblings notice the abandonment i get relating to my studies, where it has caused me to try and aim for the high not to be the best just to be appreciated by my parents.After all that was done in my country there are limited scholarships a person could apply to and with my grades i thought I could have easily got one and by this time i would have choices to pick from but because of covid my grades were insignificant because many students got their grades up by cheating. And there is one month left and I am still anxious if ill get the scholarship i desire and this has trully ruined my mood over the holidays and made me not care about many things i just would not bother to do anything it has been a long tire full journey of studying and not to get appreciated from anyone makes me depressed and starting to not even care about the foundation that i have built i studied and worked hard to excell at every part possible but i could not get the recognition i deserved either from my parents or the scholarships Trauma with studies",1

"Just 2 weeks ago got the diagnosis of having bpd (borderline personality disorder) which basically is a very narrow ability to feel things. it is either very high or very low - nothing in between and depression ""just"" is a side effect of it. it is not same for everyone but to me it was i never was able to feel things like being in love or like someone. it was either fully love someone or hate of which the love part got lost over the last 10-15 years. All that i have since i was 6 years old... now - 40 years later (10 weeks ago) it went so heavy and unhandable that i decided to start a therapy. first weeks i thought ""ah - therapy does not help anything - maybe better stop it"" but i was super lucky with the doctor in there - i started to build up trust to him (which for a borderliner is extremely rare) and more weeks went in. At around week 7 or 8 some weird effects kicked in - i started to get feelings i never knew before (all that stuff that is in between very high and very low) which is very irritating because there is no way for me to handle those feelings. Some i even cannot name. But i read and i talked to the therapists and found out that this is the way to get around with the illness...next step would be get rid of the self harm and suicidal thoughts and the deep wrath and hate which is my base feeling level (only against myself - never against another person). Problem with that is that this will take around 3 to 7 years. Sorry for long intro but now to the problem : one of those new feelings is what others would call being in love. Have no experience with that feeling and as dumb as it sounds no idea how to handle it (i know that usually every teen knows what to do with this feeling) and i fell in love with one of the women who also are in therapy where i am. This feeling is so strange and hurts so extremely much that i just had to vent about it to people who may understand it at least a bit. Acting towards this feeling is totally impossible to me because i will not know how and it would be super selfish because that woman has her own problems to carry. (besides the part that times where women were attracted to me are long gone.)I know it is a very long text and that maybe no one has the nerve and / or time to read all us.

"Constant heart anxiety. I’ve been lurking on this sub for about two weeks. It all started one morning after shoveling heaps of snow and ice off of my car for about 40 minutes. I got to work and felt a distinct fluttery feeling in my chest several times over the course of an hour or two. That has subsided, but for the past two weeks I’ve had what I can only describe as a discomfort in my upper left chest that comes and goes. 

I’ve always been the person who googles every single symptom and constantly catastrophizes every situation. So after this incident I’ve monitored every ache and pain, every strange feeling, every random heartbeat that seems too strong or out of place. I am 31f, and I have many symptoms of acid reflux and also a great deal of general anxiety. It also doesn’t help that I work on my feet moving and lifting things all day long so while I get in a healthy step count daily, my arms, shoulders, back, and legs are usually hurting one way or the other.

I am scheduling an appointment with my GP, but I’m hoping to find some reprieve from the constant googling, as well as the fueling of my anxiety caused by any minor, unfamiliar twinge in my body. Any advice is greatly appreciated!

She found a therapist and I started medication for ADD. It helped, and I continued taking it until I graduated in 2017. My freshman year, my friend had committed suicide. It never really hit me until his funeral. Where I promised to myself to never cause that much pain to the people that love me. I swore that day I would never commit suicide while I still have friends and family that love me. Just so I could never cause them that much pain. But I’ve realized something changed in me or rather, hasn’t changed in me since that day. I’m not living for me. I haven’t been living for me in such a long time. I’ve only ever lived for the people I care about. Recently my 8 year long relationship came to an end. I tell myself it’s for the best. That I couldn’t treat her right anymore. That we grew apart. But she understood sadness and depression. She lived with it for all of her life. And I failed her by letting my resentment of our relationship get the better of me. I’m proud she was able to leave me. I couldn’t ever leave her, I wasn’t strong enough. So now I’m left with the realization. I have been living my life 3 months at a time. Never looking further because I feel that I will be dead by next year. Feeling like it doesn’t matter what I do. I’ve set myself goals and I’m getting therapy for the first time in over a decade. But I can’t shake the feeling of failure. The feeling that, no matter what I do, it won’t matter. Because I’ve masked this feeling since I was young. Because I believed the lie I was telling everyone. And now that lie is witness to the world. So my question is, Is anyone truly happy? Is anyone actually happy? Because for me, happiness was chasing a feeling of being wanted, being appreciated, respected. I could only catch small instances of it. So now I ask, how do I become happy again?

TL:DR- Is anyone really happy? Can I feel happiness again? How do I be happy?",1

I have a full time Job. Married. Two dogs. No debt and I am turning 25 in a few months. I graduated with my bachelors is psychology. I help people with chronic mental illness and homelessness and take so much abuse from them its not even funny. I am resentful about how my employers pay me I am currently making 44k a year and I am trying to further my education but I keep getting denied into masters programs. Getting paid that much at 24 years old makes me feel like I have failed right out of the gate. I budgeted like a mad man and was able to save about 40k for a down payment for a house. But the market is so insane that we cannot even come close to the offers. I feel like I have done all of that budgeting for nothing.. I spent 19 years of my life being a devoted Christian believing every word and building my faith. My degree in psychology showed me that my faith was incorrect and taught me to look for evidence in what I believe. I feel so isolated because my wife still believes along with nearly all of my friends. My wife knows and she has been very supportive. My parents keep asking me when I am getting a new job.I applied for a new one I was accepted but they wanted to pay me around 15 percent LESS than I am making now. I am starting to drink and get high nearly everyday and I have picked up a porn addiction that I thought I got rid of. Resentment towards my wife because I feel like I get rejected atleast 3-4 times a week for sex. And now I am starting to blow my money that I worked hard for on nothing.. Idk I have pretty much everything going for me and I know I should be thankful I just keep getting caught in this route of wanting perfection and I keep comparing myself to others. I have had thoughts of suicide and since working in mental health I feel like I have lost faith in the system to reach out or to even talk to a therapist. Which is what I want to be.I could never leave my wife or family like that. But man I am just really not enjoying life right now. I hope some day that I will. Last thing I want to be is a victim. I am just not happy. Really needed to get this out. My life is perfect but I am miserable,1

"I was healthy and did not need any surgery especially to remove healthy skin and tissue that is suppose to be there. I feel violated and harmed by what was done to me. Being born male seems to come with the idea that we cannot clean ourselves enough tgat we have to be surgically altered in a way that would not be allowed to be done to girls.The argument that smegma collects in the foreskin is still true for girls in the clitoral hood (their foreskin) and labia. Women also produce smegma. The idea it may be beneficial should in no way justify surgery on a healthy child. There are so many other surgeries that could be beneficial but are not done because it would be considered unethical. An example would be to remove breast tissue from girls as that would get rid of the possibility of breast cancer, think of how many lives would be saved. it is the same logic. I have never experienced sex the way I was suppose to by nature. My bodily integrity was stolen from me. Society had more say over my body and has stolen full ownership over it. I had absolutely no immediate medical necessity for any surgery. I was healthy and was still subjected to a non therapeutic surgery. My rights were violated! My rights were violated but society justifes it",1

"I have had a lot of trouble transferring my anti-depressants from my old pharmacy to my new one in a new state. I started this process when i still had 3-4 days left of my medication (insurance will not cover a refill before then), and at this point I have been out for a week. Old symptoms are starting to come back. Intrusive thoughts are taking up a lot of my time today. I am tearing up at the drop of a dime. My productivity is slipping. I am easily overwhelmed. I do not have a new therapist out here yet either, which is making this harder. I cannot stand this, I had almost forgotten what this all felt like, its been almost months since these symptoms have affected me. I am worried I will start going through the really bad symptoms of withdrawal from being forced to cold-turkey stop my medications, and I feel like the pharmacists are sick of hearing from me, and I have stopped being polite to the hospital employees who have majorly fucked this up (for example, they sent my medication to a completely different pharmacy over an hour away from me 2 days ago for processing, simply because it was the same company as my old pharmacy, even though I put my new pharmacy's information in the system last week.) I am not ok, I needed to vent, I am trying my hardest to cope, but holy FUCK this sucks. I have been out of my medication for about a week now, and old symptoms are starting to come back.",1

"Though a bit of rumination, and a bit of introspection while stopped at a red lamp, I realized that exactly the same amount of good things get numbed out while trying to shrug off bad stuff as bad stuff itself.And there is a tripping point: when your numbness itself grows large enough to become ""bad stuff"", this becomes self fueling - trying to get away from numbness by getting numb enough to make it not count could actually only be achieved by not having a functional brain anymore. Sorry for the pun, but you cannot ""outnumb"" numbness itself... Like it was physical matter: too much of it gets in a too small space, collapsing into a blackhole: and you basically get sucked in there, and then no light comes back out ever. All your desires, dreams, love, ambition - they are held tightly inside the infinite gravity of the blackhole your brain made - to evade the bad stuff. And now you are stuck in permanent Bad-stuff-land...At least for my current situation, this seems to be painfully fitting.Thoughts? Equilibrium of numbness -&gt; blackhole of numbness... Thoughts?",1

"TW: mention of suicide, self harm, and abuse I wanted to share this story hopefully to give someone out there struggling some hope. When I was around 13 I was struggling with really bad depression. I was constantly in and out of mental hospitals and my biological father would not get me therapy and would not allow me to get medication to help. He and his girlfriend where very controlling of me and I suffered a lot of emotional abuse. It got to the point where I would self harm on the daily and if they seen it they would mock me for it. I was once left on the side of the road with no idea on how to get home and no phone. I was not allowed to eat carbs or anything high in sugar. They convinced me I was severely overweight where I was roughly 180lbs at the time. They gaslighted me and always reminded me of how great of a life I had because I had clothes and a roof over my head. To this day I have a hard time admitting that what I went through was abuse and not just strict parenting. One day I had a really bad breakdown and ended up yelling back at my stepmom. My dad came home said almost nothing to me but to get on the back of his motorcycle. I did and he took me to a little Italian restaurant. We sat in a booth on the corner and had a long talk. A younger couple, maybe in there early 20s, where seated next to us. The woman was blonde and very pretty, and who I assume was her date was a man whose face I did not see. The most rememberable part was when I said, Dad I want to kill myself, does that really mean nothing to you? He was quiet for a second as he thought about it but showed no emotion. Then he looked me in the eyes and said, I believe you think you do but you will not. This triggered something in me. It was at that moment I decided as soon as we got on that freeway on his bike I was going to jump in front of the biggest vehicle I could see. I do not remember saying much after that I just focused on finishing my eggplant parmesan. He got up to pay for the bill and as soon as he was gone the lady sat where he was and asked if she could talk to me. I hesitated then nodded. She told me that I was beautiful and intelligent and a few other things. She reminded me of the future I could have. My tears stopped as I held back a sob. My dad yelled my name and told me to get up. I remember flinching but I do not know what kept me on that seat. I could have been frozen in fear or just latching on to this strangers kind words. She said everything I needed that did not even know I needed to hear. Even if that conversation did not last longer then 2 minutes it changed my life. Now I am in a safe place with a great support system. I plan on studying to become a licensed therapist and helping kids. I wanted to share this story for anyone who is going through a tough time. It sounds cliche but I promise no matter the situation you are in right now, life will get better. A stranger saved my life",1

"The title is not meant to discourage others, but it is what I feel things have come to in my personal experience with life. I just want to get some stuff of my chest, even though it will not help for long. What better place to do it- than *Reddit*? I do not know, but I will still do it. I do not expect anyone to say the magic words that help, so this is again more for me to unload. However there is a possibility someone can help- so it does not hurt. I also rarely write large amounts of texts like this, so I am sorry for the confusion you might get from the out of order- randomness- etc.. from this text.This is also going to be really long, as I will include many things- both as background and as reason.If you struggle with things yourself, please do not take my text as a sign to be discouraged. I feel terrible when I see others struggle and I wish I could help them. **let us start with a little about me:**My first name is Adrian- the rest will remain anon. I am just about to turn 24 years old, live in Norway and have a stable full time job. I have an apartment, a car and money is not an issue.When most people hear that, they think I have life perfectly under control- that I am more lucky than others. And- to a degree that is true. I have been more lucky than many people in this world- but it is not what I have in my possession that brings me happiness. What brings me down is my social anxiety- combined with depression. I have a *somewhat different* type of social anxiety, but I was still diagnosed with it. I can be in crowds, be it in malls or shopping centers- stores- whatever it might be without an issue. Talking to strangers is not an issue, unless it is random chatting. By that I mean, if I am to pay for what I am buying and have do exchange a few words with the clerk in order to get something from the medical cabinet or something similar I have no issues at all. I think that is because I know what to say, how to respond and all that- it is all been done before enough times where I am comfortable doing it. When it comes to random chat however... it is tough to even do with my family. Primarily because I have nothing to talk about. When I am at work, and my colleagues are having a chat- I never join in because I have no clue how to participate. Even the colleague who is just 1 year older than me seems to have done a million more things and therefor have a lot more to talk about. While I sit there, trying to think of *something* interesting I can mention- but I am completely blank. When I do however get asked about something I do know, it is quite alright- until I make some sort of mistake (like stating a fact, that turned out to be false) I feel like an idiot. I do not show that though- I shrug it off and pretend I found it sort of funny. I live most of my life currently pretending I am happy, like everything is fine. I work at a place I cannot show my depression to others. I imagine most places would be like that however. I am quite good at that now, do not think most people know my life is... bad. **let us go back in time a bit:**Quite early in my life, after changing schools because of moving- I was starting to become a target from bullies. The good old classic. Some people would constantly pick on me, other people pretended to be disgusted when I was nearby- some just ignored me and so on. The school's solution to this was to remove me from class... I thought back then that was great, get me away from those people. I have however come to realize that it was probably a bad solution. I never got to work with other students, never really had a chance to socialize the little bit you can during class. I was alone, with a teacher of my own. I did have a few friends, so that was something- but long story short I messed that up and lost them.This went on until the end of 10th grade. Get bullied, picked on- and have a few nice people that I would stick with until something happened that made them go away. Then high school arrived- and I was excited for a new chance with new people. (and of course I liked the school.) The first few months, I attended school but gained no contacts. No one treated me bad so I did not really mind that.. Until one day where I entered my classroom, 2 girls were standing by the door and laughed when I passed them. Thinking back at it now, I think it was just a coincidence- but back then it dropped my self esteem right back to the ground. 1 of those girls I even found attractive, so that did not help. Then after a little more time things become quite good. I became friends with a few in class, and the rest still treated me quite alright. The only thing that made me feel bad was the thought I still had not had a girlfriend. (This was at the age of 16, quite early to sob about such a thing.). Year 2 of high school, I went the route for car mechanics. I was back at the start of having no contacts, friends or such. I was still treated alright by everyone though. I asked some people if I could join them when they drove to the store to get lunch (some were over 18)- and they said I would be able to join them- it one of the car seats were not taken by a spare wheel. I felt neutral about that, because at least they did not talk down on me or anything. Later that year I made friends again. Great right? Indeed it was, school was fun again. (Fun fact, one of the people in this group was the girl I earlier stated I found attractive.) The only relevant things from the rest of the year is about said girl. She was now a friend- and I did not want to ruin that. So despise people saying she was interested in me I took no chances. So I treated her as a friend, until near Christmas where I finally decided to somewhat casually ask her about going out and do something together. That was the day she just became the girlfriend of someone else in class. I was back at the bottom, but pretended to be happy. Back then I was terrible at pretending and people kept asking why I was down. did not feel it was worth talking about so I walked away. She, and the others though did remain my friends out that year. School year ended, and people from that group started to become somewhat snappy- passive aggressive. So I gave up on them too. I did however remain friends with said girls- boyfriend. Next year, I retake the same year but with another subject. Same procedure, sit alone most of the time at first- then I make 2 friends. We shared interest in gaming so we played online quite a bit. I believe these 2 were the best friends I had made. There is of course a girl in class I found attractive- and she had a difficult personality to understand... I misunderstood her all the time and kept thinking she despised me. That of course did make me feel horrible a lot during that year. At this time, I do believe my main because of depression was things like this. The year ends, and I have to find a job- but I fail. I think I got 1 singular interview during the summer. They did not want me there so I was without a job. Here is where I got lucky, a company calls me and asks me to come in for an interview. I get there, and see the ""attractive girl from last school year"" was also called in for an interview. At this point I do however realize I am not despised and we had neutral opinions of each other. (At least that is what I believe). Both of us get the job (as apprentices), so there is that. During the next 2 years nothing interesting happens, except me constantly feeling horrible about life- and not having a single good experience on apps like Tinder and so on. Before I continue, let us fill out a bit how dating apps have hurt me. By the time I had reached 18, my depression was quite strong. I did honestly feel like people hated me but were nice and hid it. While using the apps, I was often unmatched within the first 5 seconds of matching. That did hurt when it had happened for the 20th time. I never dared to say hi to anyone- so that is my fault I guess. Those who said hi to me first- made me feel good! For about 5 minutes until you could clearly tell in the messages they were uninterested. (Like the saying, talking to a wall.)These apps, did bring me even further down overall. Never up. Back to the real life part. &amp;#x200B;After 2 years you take sort of an exam, and after that you are no longer an apprentice. I scored maximum. (3 points, excellent.) So did the girl I was working with. One of the people I worked with suggested I invited the girl out for a ""celebratory"" dinner for finishing school 100% with a good score. It was worth a shot. She denied that immediately. (This did, once again- destroy me inside, but in the long run it was for the better.) Both of us get's the opportunity to continue working for a partner company as long as the interview goes well. That it did. We both remained colleagues so that is when I realized it was indeed good she said no. About at this time though, I make a incredibly stupid decision to ""reset my social life"". I thought if I could get myself into a completely new social environment I would maybe have a better life in general. I did this because I was still constantly feeling horrible- like people disliked me and such. After this I never made new friends, and 3- soon 4 years later here I am- still alone. I have never found another opportunity even to make new friends, I no longer meet new people. The people I meet at work are a lot older (no offence to them). And those my age still seem to look down on me. That is the big thing with me, I feel like everyone looks down on me- even without proof. The thing is, with social anxiety- is one notices so many details of how one reacts to your presence. Even to details that were never even there. I still am like this... Quite a bit of people have given me suggestions on how to deal with things- I have even tried talking to a psychologist. Nothing worked. When people say good things to be- it goes in one ear, and out the other. When people say rude things, it sticks like glue. I cannot take praises seriously anymore. I cannot take advices. I do not see the worth of anything. All in all, I ***really*** wish I never existed. I have done nothing good to this world. I have been destroyed- I no longer want help. I just want it to be over. The only things that make me feel good, even just for a moment- is random things like a stranger saying something nice. Compliments from people I know, do nothing. I honestly think, the only thing that would get me out of this she will- is a semi-random situation that for example results in me making a new acquaintance. But we all know that is not how the world works, especially for someone who is always at home when he is not at work. Summary: I do not think I can be helped anymore. My mind instantly switches anything positive to the negative. I was recently back at a neutral state, but then I had yet again a negative experience with another person- which brought right back down to the floor. I feel worthless- and all the other negative emotions one tend to feel during depression. This text became a complete mess, I know. There is even a ton of stories I wanted to fit in- but it will just clutter it all up at this point. The results of my depression was, a couple years back I made a deal with myself.I will give life a chance to redeem itself. I have set a date in the future- which I will not share- but it is still several years until. If I still live alone, with no friends- with no sense of purpose- with ***no light in the tunnel*** I am in... I will take my leave. It did in a way help to unload this, but not as much as I had hoped- because it did at the same time bring back couple bad memories of life.. I do not really plan on paying attention to the comments here, but knowing myself I will probably still do it. I would also like to finally point out, that (as mentioned partially in rule 5.) most replies with long explanations that in short just tells you that ""just to this and it all works out"" will not work. I am a very complicated work of machinery (not literally). For those who are just reading- thanks for your time, and if you are struggling with something I do truly hope you figure it out.. I know how it is... I just cannot figure out my issues. Not everyone can be helped",1
"Doctors notes/records Hi just wondering if anybody knows about if doctors think you are drug seeking do they put that on your record? 
I went to doctors yesterday, didn’t see my usual GP, it was about spinal pain that radiates up my back, only seems to hurt after physical activity which is weird but concerning to me. The day before appointment I went gym &amp; done some light training on back muscles which really set it off, was painful &amp; felt weird afterwards like weakness in my arms, bit dizzy and just a general weak feeling like really weak and disorientated. She was not helpful at all, basically done a quick op’s check, checked my back briefly &amp; said it seems ok. She said to rest on weekend and see how I go, she said hot water bottle. The more im thinking about my appointment with a her yesterday I get the impression she feels I was drug seeking. I never asked for any drugs but I feel she was misunderstanding me being concerned with trying to get drugs. She said something when I sat down like “you’re looking to discuss pain management” I didn’t really take it in as was really anxious and tired so I said yeah about my spine then proceeded to talk about my concerns, but not once did I say anything about wanting medications/drugs. I’m annoyed now I should of been clear that I would of liked a referral to be checked out or something. I’m on pregabalin for anxiety (it also just happens to be a nerve pain drug) and she said few times about you’ll have review soon with usual GP to see if it’s helping my anxiety and not just about pain management. She also said you’ve only upped dosage 10 days ago. I didn’t really take it in properly at the time but I feel she thinks I was trying to up my dose or get pain meds? I’m worried now that it will be on my notes and I’m also frustrated that I didn’t correct her properly. Any advice or help on this would be appreciated im very anxious about this, I feel I was totally misunderstood and I don’t like the thought of her putting on notes I was looking for pain management or medication to help that. I also noticed as I was leaving she done a frustrated sigh. This experience has made me feel invalidated, misunderstood and made my anxiety and depression worse. I’m struggling mentally very very bad to say the least.",2

"I hope this does not sound stupid. I have seen the same psychiatrist for 5 years, he is prescribed me meds and I talk to him every few months, nothing special. he is never really taken a big interest in my mental health, which I was fine with because as long as I got my medication I did not complain.But yesterday I went to see a new primary care doctor for a minor health problem. When I got there he went over all my medications with me and he actually also specializes in psychiatry. So instead of a quick visit about something minor, he ended up talking to me about my mental health for 2 hours and having me fill out a bunch of questionnaires. I did not expect to have to talk about my mental health at all with him, so I got super overwhelmed with all of it. He seems super genuine and really interested in helping make sure I am on the right medications and whatnot. He said we would go over all my answers in a follow up appointment next week.But because I was so anxious and emotional over it all, I lied on the questionnaires about some things (severity of my depression, some diet issues I have had, etc) and I feel like shit about it. I know that by lying about that stuff I am not doing myself any favors, especially when this doctor seems to actually want to help me out.Would it be weird to call and be honest about lying and ask if I can fill them out again? I do not want to seem like a crazy person, but I also do not want to lie and not get the treatment I need.Any suggestions are appreciated! Got overwhelmed with a new doctor and lied on some of the mental health questionnaires. Should I be honest about lying and ask to fill them out again?",1

The one thing i hate most about being undiagnosed is i get all these things to help me cope. Like take a walk or do this when I am feeling depressed. I have a new therapist who is a temporary one while we look for a permanent one. And so i cannot get meds even if i wanted. But people do not understand that I am depressed most days and i hate the days that I am actually happy and forget about my problems because the depression is soon to come back. Its weird. I have a boyfriend and we have a great time sometimes and other times he sees me upset and wants to help but he cannot. I hate when people offer ways to get through it when they do not understand that it effects everyone differently. And yes my bf does make me feel better when he stops what hes doing to try and comfort me for whatever reason I am depressed. He trys his best to help me get through it and I have asked for help from this therapist and online I have googled ways to help. Most of them are the same of go for a walk get some sun light do something you enjoy doing. But the hard part is finding the motivation to do any of that and its like they do not understand that. My bf kind of gets it because hell come cuddle or hell rub my back because he knows its hard to get out of bed for me. I am just tired of people thinking that everyone with depression is the same. I am tired of people assuming,1

"I am so fed up with my life. I am a nihilistic, bitter, shallow, ugly inside and out individual, virgin at 23, still living with his mom and stepdad. I was raised by a narcissistic, sociopath father who had magnetically attractive looks like the likes of Johnny Depp or George Clooney. He selectively chose my mom because of her unique beauty and basically abused her and manipulated her for two decades. My dad was a comic, he never took anything seriously and would put on a show for everyone, but behind closed doors he was a twisted freak. After I was born I quickly developed a skull deformity that could have been prevented, called plagiocephaly, and my uniquely good looks quickly grew into an asymmetric, ugly caricature of how I should have. My dad treated me special and said I was better than everyone else when I was really young in elementary school, and this was reinforced by some girls who gave me attention, but this was before my skull grew more and I went through puberty. As I became more shutin as I grew because of my insecurity, my dad began to really crank up his drinking and eventually got into hard drugs before my mom essentially 'escaped' him and left me and my brother for years to care for him. He eventually died, I had to find him myself, and it still hurts me to this day, as bad of a man as he was. I moved in with my mom around 16 and have been a recluse ever since, aside from working. I have become more lonely and depressed. I am weird and ugly looking as well when I should have been handsome enough to cruise through life. My mindset is so terrible but it goes to show how stunted my brain is. The way my life is unfolding is tragic in a very weird way.",1

"Tips on how to accept my symptoms are just anxiety and start living again?? The last month has been such a struggle for me. I started having panic attacks where my heart rate would spike to 150-180. I went to my doctor in case it wasn’t anxiety and just had my Holter Monitor results come back. I had one of these attacks while on it and thankfully no dangerous rhythms were found. Just some high rates but not sustained so my doctor is unconcerned. So once again, this is all anxiety. 

My therapist thinks it’s because I started a new job last month and I’m falling back into my old health anxiety habits because “Stress compounds symptoms”. 

This has gotten so bad that the past week I haven’t even been able to leave my bed out of fear of my heart getting too high. Due to probably the fear when I cooked or did dishes my heart rate could get up to 130 then if I noticed and began to worry it went up to 160.

Now that I know I’m fine I thought I’d be okay but I’m still constantly watching my smart watch to see how high my heart rate gets then panicking when I see it go above 120 from just walking around the house but when I’m calm it doesn’t go over like 110. This happened on the Holter and it was normal. I know this is just anxiety but I can’t stop obsessing that I have a heart issue that’ll kill me. 

I just need help to take the smart watch off and stop taking my blood pressure. It’s just making everything worse. Yesterday alone, according to my logs, I took my blood pressure 50 times. I was worried because my bp was low when standing yet my heart rate was high so I thought it was dangerous. It happened again this morning and my heart rate got to 165. This constant checking is driving me crazy and ruining my life. How do I stop this??",2

"To those who give car rides UPDATE IN COMMENTS: I’m a college student from out of state. I left home because I didn’t like the environment I was in, and being out of state was one of the best options. I don’t have a car and it’s mostly a public transportation type place so it’s not the biggest issue. I don’t ask people for rides unless I really need them. If we go out, I’ll tell them we can take the bus. On rare occasions if I need it I’ll ask for a ride. I was getting close to someone and only then did I ask them to take me to target twice, once we went, the other we didn’t and the second time I really needed to go for a project. So you kinda get the jist of it. When I need to go to and from the airport I has rely on others, this is one are I need help in because Ubers are so expensive (also I only need it after and before the winter, summer, and one thanksgiving break). I generally don’t care too much about it’s safety because I feel it’s generally safe, but this one time it’s kind of an issue. 

I also would like to mention that I don’t really have friends in school. 

Anyways, I ended up contacting many MANY people. They all basically said no. The flight would come in at around 12 AM and none of them could pick me up. I honestly got angry. My thought process was that I’m literally in a bad situation, I need a ride, and no one can either wake up or cut their plans short? It honestly just made me so frustrated. I get im not your best friend, but a girl taking an Uber at 12AM-1AM isn’t okay for many. I’m not the type to go out a lot so it’s uncomfortable for me. 

I get it’s late at night, but it just made me feel like people are selfish. I hope I never treat others the way I feel when I ask others for a ride. Because it feels terrible, and I’m not saying these people are the exact reason why I feel this way. I’m sure it’s an accumulation, but it just feels so terrible. 

I hate having to beg and pry and ask. I hate asking for a ride so I do try my best to get there myself. I even offer to pay because I don’t want people to do it for free and then me feel like I’m always bothering them.

I don’t know what to do, I know I’m emotional about this but people who have cars and give others a ride should try and be more empathetic to those who don’t.",3

"**So this might be a very weird title, and probably an even weirder story but I am going to share it with you anyway:**Since 2018 I have been a big fan of a band, Iron Maiden. You might have heard of them since they are pretty popular. I started listening to this band when I was still in school and decided to go to a concert with my dad which originally would take place in the summer on 2019. Now with the corona and all it got postponed to the summer of 2022 already. As of late I feel like I might be obsessed with Iron Maiden, maybe in a good way but not necessarily. I love their music very much, seen every DVD and love to read interviews and stories about them. Iron Maiden helped me through a tough time last year when someone very close to me got hospitalised with Covid-19 and almost died because of it. Luckily that person survived and is still with us, which I am grateful for every day of my life&amp;#x200B;But now the reason why I wanted to share my story in this subreddit: Iron Maiden are a very old band. they have been going since the 80's already and their oldest member is 69 at the moment. I have only become a fan of them in 2018 meaning I missed out on so much. I could not have been there since the beginning since I was born in 1998. But the things I missed make me feel miserable. The great journeys the band had, the amazing adventures they went on and I missed it all.To add to this, they announced a new album coming in September 2021, the 17th album to be exact. Rejoice you would say right? Well, wrong. I feel very sad and would almost call it depressed. I hardly sleep and I cannot find fun in the little things anymore like playing a game or going on trips with my girlfriend. Every time I read something about Iron Maiden or watch a video/ DVD I get so sad since they are at the end of their career and I have only been there for such a short while. I want to be so excited for the upcoming album and support the band on perhaps their last tour but I just cannot.I know this probably all sounds very stupid and you are probably scratching your heads on why I make such a big deal out of this. And to be perfectly honest, I am wondering the same thing. I feel so stupid that I feel this way but I do not know what I can do to stop it. The realisation that my favourite band might quit in a few years is something I cannot accept.My girlfriend nor my parents do not really seem to get it either. They know I am an avid Iron Maiden fan but they do not get why I am so sad when talking about the end of their career. it is not like they make fun of me for feeling this way, it is just like they think it is weird that it means so much to me. I sometimes think I might be autistic since it bothers me this much.&amp;#x200B;I do not know if there is any advice that would help me, but I wanted to share my feelings right here. Iron Maiden will always stay with me but I am so afraid that I might fall in a very deep depression once they announce the end and that is something I do not want. I have a beautiful girlfriend with whom I plan to have children in the future and grow old together.

"My depression has turned me into a she will of the person that I (22F) once was. I have been through several episodes of severe clinal depression.I used to consider myself very intelligent. I was a gifted student, winning awards and ranking in the 99th percentile on standardized tests. Now I am in community college struggling to pass the same courses I took at an AP equivalent years ago. Perhaps most alarmingly, I cannot learn anything new. I try and I try to retain what I take in, but the honest truth is that I have cheated on most of my coursework.Aside from my deteriorating intelligence, I was unbelievably creative. I used to draw, write- create-with such a level of detail and vividness I was consistently told my art and writing felt real and touched people at the core. Its been 7 months since I have seriously tried to draw anything. Longer since I have written.Also, just generally I am slow in conversations. This is something I noticed develop during quarantine. I started living alone for the first time in my life after a breakup. Now I say utterly /dumb/ shit when I do speak to people- its like I have no filter and my brain is at 10% operating power. This has made it difficult for therapy to be effective, because I am so self-conscious about how I communicate.I am terrified. If this is the course of my life- I do not want it. If I am stagnating, to solve this, I feel I need to go on some sort of journey to find the lost parts of me, or at least a place where I feel more at peace.I try to practice mindfulness, but without fail I prioritize work and school- which stress me immensely- the 2 things my psychologist recommended I throw myself headlong into. It does not work for me though. I need time in a day to just exist, I cannot be mentally stimulated all the time- its exhausting.I have one close friend. I do not see him more than once a week on average. Hes busy with 3 jobs. I would love to have more friends, but I never seem to connect with people anymore.Why am I like this? And is there any advice you can offer? Help",1
"(vent) I probably got cavities from grinding my teeth for years and i'm fed up with being so anxious all the time This is my first post here, i just recently found this subreddit and it already helped me a lot just reading everyones posts. I always felt like i was completely alone in this, as my close family and friends are usually brushing me off. Also i apologize in advance, i'm not a native speaker so my english might be a bit off at times.

Anyway, the main point of this is to just... put my feelings out there. I'd guess a few of you can relate. I hope this won't be too much, since i do tend to overshare when i'm depressed and i am depressed at the moment.

I've been anxious and obsessive ever since i can remember. Couple of years ago i was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and major depression, as well as BPD. Two years ago i was also diagnosed with AvPD and OCPD. I went through DBT two times, a third time is already scheduled. I was in therapy for over 5 years, but i have to quit. I've also been on Pregabalin for two years.

Health Anxiety started last year for me, after I had finally cut ties with an emotionally abusive friend who basically made the past four years a living hell. I don't know if that was the cause but it happened around the same time. 

I've always grinded my teeth at night and i was wearing a mouth guard ever since that was discovered. However recently i lost mine, as i lost my bag during traveling (which has caused a lot of stress for me over the past week, as losing things is something i've always been anxious about), so the grinding has been worse. 

Thanks to my medication i have a very dry mouth and to top that off i also currently have a very bad cold, that's already got me on edge wether i'm developing pneumonia. 

Yesterday night was a very bad time for me. While brushing teeth my gums were bleeding a lot - i have very good oral hygiene, my doctor has never had any complaints and my gums never bleed - so brushed my teeth, used mouth wash and then went to sleep, trying to not go into the anxiety cycle again. After that however instead of falling asleep I spend hours googling things and being caught up in memories of said former abusive friend. I don't know where that came from, but it just overwhelmed me. 

Today i found a tiny black spot on my teeth, that won't go away. It looks like a tiny hole. And instead of listening to what i learned in therapy - i should've known better - i googled again. Turns out you can get cavities from grinding your teeth and wearing them down. I am fairly certain this is what's going on and i've scheduled an appointment for Monday. And now i'm trying to find ways to get through the weekend without too much stress, because i'm worried that might make my cold even worse and... you all probably can guess how the cycle spirals downwards from here.

The thing i wanted to say about all this is the following: This sucks. Majorly. I am so tired of this anxiety, this obsessive overthinking of everything my body does; i'm tired of all these bad things that happened in the past still haunting me to this day. I'm tired of all the diagnosis i got - it feels like there's no chance of recovery because of all the things i have to work through. And i'm also tired of being aware that stress will wear my body down but that thought alone is causing me so much stress that it's a long spiral i can't seem to escape from. This right now feels like another punishment for not getting this right. I'm trying not to be too negative, but the thoughts keep forming in my head. Sometimes i just wish i could start anew because after i learned in therapy just exactly how all my problems started and how they escalated, i just wish i could redo my life and stop the anxiety before it even got this bad. 

I will continue to work through this. As we all do. I know that me wishing for a new start will never come to be and maybe that wouldn't even be for the best. I know i'm not and neither is anyone else here responsible for this condition. Right now it just felt like the thoughts were overwhelming me and i needed to tell someone. I know this can be beat, i just feel at a low point right now.

If you read this, thank you for listening to me.",2

"I tried something two months ago that I would not recommend without talking to your psychiatrist first. I slowly tapered myself off of Effexor because I was tired of the sexual side effects and the extreme withdraws that happen if you, God forbid, forget a dose. As predicted, the withdrawals were hell even tapering and now I am back to my baseline. So I am left with a very angry, irritable and depressed version of myself. No amount of exercise, diet etc will change this. I have found a new psychiatrist and will be speaking to them this week about a new regiment. The psychiatrist takes a holistic approach but does not exclude pharmaceuticals. I am wondering what are some alternatives. I do not want to go on a heavy drug like Effexor. Maybe there are some better pharmaceuticals. Of course Ill get this advice from my doctor but I guess I am just venting here. I feel so helpless to needing a drug. I suppose a diabetic feels the same way or a cancer patient or someone with HIV. The anger, temper and irritability is what really concerns me most of all. I am afraid of doing something dumb on the street if somebody were to like bump into me. that is a real bad one. Something that pharmaceuticals eliminated. I can, however have an orgasm in 5 minutes as opposed to 5 hours. Tapered off Effexor and now back to angry, raging me.",1

I am so done with myself but i know i cannot do it. coz i cannot. its all fake. i think I am suicidal but i cannot even kill myself. i cannot even hurt myself now. idk what to do I am too lazy to try but I am too weak to die. I am just standing still doing notthing. everythings empty. its all blank. idk its all confusing and messed up idk what to do. and i cannot even explain myself well. and i do not have anyone to talk to and idk i do not understand myself and idk if someone understands but I am just a fake finiding comfort and i do not deserve that because I am just faking everything i can think rationally so i should have no problem thinking and I am so horrible to people i do not dersever any comfort.you know in life stories where they tell you keep on trying and do hard work you are stronger even tho you have this disadvantages etc idk. like they try to encourage this person that have all the reasons in the world to be down. well that is not me. I am the one n those stories that are compared to trying hard guys that do nothing. the one who takes advantage of everything and try to act like a victim. I am the bad guy in stories that do not have resolve. the one people should bash on the internet and wish death on. that type of person. and now idk what to do. coz i do not have the strength to die.even tho i kno its better like that to just end it all I am fake.,1

"Tw/mention of suicide, mention of self harmI'm going through intense feelings these last weeks, because I am depressed, never really injured myself or tried to do something worse, but the feelings, the thoughts and the sensory overload were raging in my head.I am still searching for a good med to help me but yesterday, my brain just stopped saying those things. Just, completely silent. No more killing myself thoughts, no more harming myself....I am in shock. Today I am okay too! I has happened before, and it was more frequent that I was in a ok mood and knew I was getting better for the moment.But I am SO afraid that those things go back to happening, I do not want to tire myself out with work, I do not want to play games/watch series and get sad (or any feelings tbh)... I want to enjoy the peace and quiet and at the same time I want to go back to normal, and work on the stuff I like, finish some games, talk with friends...Because it is getting kind of rare these moments my brain just do not go full die mode, I am so afraid to not just enjoy the moment or to do something productive.

"I do not know how to express my thoughts and feelings without feeling like an idiot, I have programmed myself to never feel externally as a means of survival, I have a solid exterior but inside I am torn to pieces.During my childhood, I constantly moved around, going to different schools, cities, I was never able to settle because my mother is a hardcore alcoholic, running from any responsibility.I used to come back from primary school and walk in on my mother passed out. I used to sit and entertain myself for hours in a silent, life less home.I used to worry about bills, electricity and food before I would even hit my teenage years. I had to walk my mother to the shop, whilst she leant her entire weight upon my shoulder, we would stagger there, day or night just so she could get her drink.When I went to school, I could not relate to the other kids, I could not laugh with them, I did not watch the same programs or like the same things, I did not have any siblings, a father, I had no guidance.During my teens, I used to jump into relationships with girls, but I was never stable enough to hold it down. I would go to school and fight the other kids, distract them in class. I was full of anger and resentment. I did not feel understood, my teachers called me names, made an example out of what not to be. I was the disruptive naughty kid. I was given detentions, put on report, constantly punished.I would come home to the same cycle, my mother passed out, or mentally checked out. Her pupils would change when she was drunk, I would know my mother was gone.Now I am 22 years old, still living with my mother, stuck in a shit hole city. I somehow managed to get a degree, determined to fight against the hand I would been dealt.I have been through waves of acceptance, anger, depression. It never truly goes away.My mother stopped drinking, supposedly found spirituality and detached from her ego. I thought she was healing, I was so proud of her and for once my home started to feel safe...I told her I think I aced a job interview today.. She started telling me all of the negatives. ""The areas not safe, people there will hurt you."" ""You will not like it it will be boring."" ""you are bad at maths, you will not be able to do it.""I have a solid exterior, I am a fully grown man now, I am tall, broad, the one thing my father gave me was good genes. I am capable, I am strong, intelligent. I have held down jobs in the past, I was a manager before I went to university.Tonight I ask her to not be so negative, I ask her why she cannot just be happy and support me for trying to better my life.. she tells me that she has done her 18 years of service to me. She says I am holding onto the energy of the past, that it is time to move on.. She tells me I should leave the house if I hate her so much.. She tells me I am selfish, a narc, that I hold her past I have her head out of spite..I am sitting here feeling pain, I feel alone, there is nobody in this world who truly has my back but me, there is nobody to pull me out of the gutter when I am in need.. There is nobody there who will truly help me..I feel so jealous of people who were raised in a loving environment. I watch people I went to school with living life, driving, living independently.. Here I am, barely able to make enough to pay off my debts, let alone save enough to leave.. The rent in my city is insane.I tried supported housing for 6 months, but living around a house full of people with hardcore drug issues made me feel like I was still at home.. People trying to come into my room.. Dirt and grime everywhere outside of my door.. Shit on the sink in the shared bathroom..Everything is so hard. I am struggling to keep fighting. I cannot tell anyone how I feel in real life, I am supposed to be this big, impenetrable guy who people can rely on..When I try to speak to people, nobody takes. It seriously.How much more can I take? When will life cut me a break? I just want to be happy, I just want to be independent, away from damaged, crazy people.. 22M - Narc alcoholic parent",1

I don't care about football tbh but I love going to superbowl parties to stuff my face with food.

If we are telling our doctors that the medication makes us feel worse or causes unwanted side effects, why would increasing the dosage make it better?",2

"I am going to put this here since I got no one else to tell. The past 2 months my mental health has completely crumbled. My friends did not reach out to me, I always had to reach out to them. It was just really obvious these past 2 months that they do not care, never did they reach out and even ask if I was okay. Just nothing. The fact that I am a lonely loser just amplified itself these past 2 months.I always thought that reaching out to a friend that you think is having a bad day was normal. My friends all knew I have depression and yet not one message of comfort was sent to me. Friends were always important to me my whole life but now that I am experiencing life after school, everything just feels so hopeless. I am stuck with depression and it feels like no matter what I do, I cannot just get rid of it. My friends always said to improve myself and whatnot, if it was that simple then I would not be this depressed and suicidal.I just felt so lonely these past 2 months. After I reached out one last time to one of my friends, he said the reason they do not reach out and check up on me is that ""we are adults now"". After he said I should just toughen up. Those words have been stuck in my head the past week. I do not know what is right or wrong anymore but what I do know is that I want to move on, I simply do not want to live anymore.Just then I removed them all from my social medias and friends lists. The amount of pain I went through my life just outweighs any good that happened. I never had a girlfriend at all and the fear of being lonely forever is eating away at me. Seeing that those friends do not care enough just made me more and more depressed by the day. Being told to toughen up is just bullshit. All these bullshit excuses and words they tell me, I just had enough of.I just hate everything, I cared so much for my friends and the care just was not returned. Anyways guys, I am probably not going to post again and honestly I feel extremely suicidal right now so this might be my last post on Reddit. Sick of it all",1

"23 year old male here. I just found out that life is extremely boring and those tiny little moments of joy are very few and you just cannot force them to happen. I have been always fascinated in creating stuff to entertain myself and others because LIFE IS JUST too boring. But I burned out and I had to leave my creative part behind only to burn out again doing traditional BORING work. I was always the weird/crazy cousin who would host ""hounted attractions"" in my bedroom just to keep my other cousins entertained. I had an iCarly.com rip-off kind of ""website"" that I created with some friends when I was barely 10. I made a lot of videos and movies using Sims characters and Habbo characters. I used to play a lot as a kid and had fun. I know all of that sounds stupid but the point is that I USED to be creative and joyful at some point of my life. But, as always, LIFE happened. I grew up, I developed a bunch of insecurities, became a nerd, I turned out to be gay, I fell apart, developed a porn addiction, my social anxiety started to rise, stopped hanging out with my childhood ex friends, put all of my teen energy on having good grade and after graduating I decided to go into Business since I knew that I would be a financial burden to my single unemployed mother had I chosen a career related to Film &amp; Arts in a third world country. But now, I graduated from college (I did great thankfully tho), and I have been working at a bank for more than year dealing with coding and database (of which I had no previous experience/knowledge on) while working remotely due to covid, spending most of my days locked in my room feeling empty, stressed out, and suicidal at how my life has turned out. I told to myself that next year I would apply to an international scholarship to do a master's degree because everyone in my circle is persuing that and I do not want to fall behind. But I still do not even know the master's degree I want to do. I am stuck. It makes no sense to persue a master's degree in arts after graduating from Business School. I hate this gray career path that my 18 year old naive self chose and my 23 year old self decided to maintain.

"So basically I started cutting my wrists and some of my friends found out. They told me to stop so I said I did, it was a complete lie. I thought they had believed me. But they did not because somehow the school counselor found out. At some point people started fucking with me because for like 2 weeks straight he was calling me to his office every other day because someone kept saying I was still cutting myself, which I was not. In one of the meetings he told me that I have obviously become someone people need to worry about and that shit hit deep. I cried about it later because that made me feel so bad. It is not even the worst thing I have had said to me, but it hurt so bad for some reason. I think its because I never wanted to be the person people had to worry about. He also told my parents that they should consider putting me in a mental institution... like wtf? Things have just gone downhill from there though. COVID happened, I became overweight (Which would not be a bad thing if my parents were so harsh about it. In one instance, My mom made me try on shirts she knew would not fit me anymore and when they were tight she told me it made her feel better.) I have been lonely, I lost one of my best friends because he thought I liked him as more than a friend and accused me of things (now he responds to my texts hours later with K or cool.)

My daughter is 8 months and I cannot help but cry every time I think too much about it, I feel bad because half of the time all I can do it put on a show for her and scroll through my phone or sleep. She is everything to me and I feel like a terrible parent. I cannot take it anymore I do not know what to do. Am I ever going to be happy?",1

"I am tired of fighting this wretched disease Tired of crying everydayFeeling like a void of existence just barely present in this world for the sake of existing An empty she will of what used to be Unsavable, beyond redemption A thread of sanity and hope snapped long agoI'm free falling into the abyss of despair and to the point of no return Alone in complete darkness Where memories goes to die This vast emptiness consumes me and I am being digested in its belly and being metabolised for energy for the parasites living within Everything part of me, my personality, my hopes and dreams, my identity in the world Used as food for the selfish Nothing in this world could fill what has been taken from me But i keep giving for that is the only thing i can retain Until i could give no more What is living if there is no meaning is the clich But what is life without living when you are not a human anymore (A walking empty void of existence)The only thing that is stopping me is death itself And death is the essence of life and the meaning of being So am i only living if I am dying? I want to end this infinity loop of suffering The pain of keeping the body alive for the sake of being just there is exscruciating And the pain never stopTill I drop .",1

I'm going to accept the consequences if I carry out the mission on my own but it does suck. My best friends are Gone possibly forever. My day ones. I still have a couple around but it's not the same you know. No female can replace a bond between my friend group. They were my niggas lol but yeah I'm only 18 and kinda willing to throw my life away already. My heart feels so cold everyday. From drug addiction to doing shit in the streets. From being abandoned at a young age to being homeless with my family. From people always looking down on me and the darkness I surrounded myself with. I despise humans besides my best friends and my family. I hate people. I'm ready to go I really don't care if I live or die. It's crazy because even my therapist told me at a young age I'd be a threat to society anyways. I'd be afraid to admit she was right. Materialistic things don't matter to me. I feel as if almost my only purpose is living for my gang. I don't feel happy ever. I just hate everyone and everything. I'm ready to go. I miss my friends. goodbye.,1

"(Trigger Warning) Does anyone else get an anxiety attack when… Is it just me? Anyone have advice on how to manage/ treat?

Or when someone is tapping their fingers or legs. It seems like I get triggered by other people’s coping mechanisms. 

This has been extremely frustrating because my bf has this habit when he is anxious and not even realizing it and it’s causing my to have attacks and then I am zorped and on edge. And he is constantly on edge trying to look out for me. 

We are trying different things like closing doors, and both trying to be mindful but I would really like help on how to manage and treat it. Does anyone else share a similar experience?

"To be quite honest, I felt validated. I have been struggling since I was 10. I am 20 now. All this time I thought there was something wrong with me or that whatever I was going through was not real. I still do not quite know how to talk about it with my family without making them worried. I struggle with suicidal ideation a lot and that is one reason why I want to tell my family that I have been struggling with depression so that they are aware of the risks. However, I do not want to seek too much attention for the fear of being taken lightly or as a liability. I do not want people to think that they are obligated to make me feel good or be there for me as a form of pity. I also feel that nobody actually cares enough so why even bother. I know that is probably not true but it is hard to convince yourself of otherwise especially when you are depressed and have a particularly bad case of low esteem. I have not had the courage to tell anyone in my real life yet, but I want to get it off my chest. After 10 years of struggle, I was finally diagnosed with clinical depression yesterday.",1

I’ve gotten off my meds, but sometimes it feels like a relapse. It’s made my taste in music change, things I used to love I don’t enjoy anymore- friends: I don’t really connect with many anymore even the people I used to see I don’t see any more. My connections seem to be gone.

The constants in my life there is maybe 4 of; my job, my family, my friends and where I live. Emotionally I’m not well. Physically I’m doing better so one thing at a time I guess.

Ever since ive moved to a new city its been back to back dog shit.

I used to think it was funny how i would always meet with the wrong people. I would joke with my cousins about it. Well im
sick of it now. Im sick of being the only one in the family with no friends. Even my deadbeat brothers have friends. I have only my cousins. And trust me i value them. But do u know how much it hurts to be on the phone with them but theyre also on the phone with their friends too? Im sick. Im also sick of liking girls. I am a girl but i dont like boys. Im tired of hearing my mom want grankids or for me to have a husband even though ive shown no interest for guys or children at all in my fucking life. I was also depressed this entire month EXCEPT my birthday and after that and i came home (because i went to miami) i got severly depressed AGAIN. i even tried to cut myself just to feel something but got scared. I ended up just deleting all my social media and going on dnd. I just wanna die. I never asked to feel all these emotions. I also hate achool. I cant hqve my phone, cant wear the clothes i like, and i do unnecessary work that wont matter in the long run, im sick of everything: i wish i could just stay home and rot in my sleep.

"By all rights, I should be an adult, I am 23 ffs. But I am Bipolar, anxious, and terrified of the family I am dependent on.

Ironically, when I tell them the truth, I am told I am a liar, an attention whore; I am the paradoxical pathological liar. One of my major lies, something nobody else really had any business knowing, is on the cusp of being found out. In all likelihood, this will be the final straw, and I will be cut off. I cannot say I would blame them, nobody wants a family member who constantly has problems. I suppose the best way is to just accept it, and take whatever happens next.

I spend the majority of that time sleeping, ""working"" for money, resting, and in pursuit of my appetites.The way my imagination works does not lend itself well to words nor drawings and I do not currently have great skills with either. I cannot transfer information to others quickly or easily. Even if I am careful in how I express my thoughts, I cannot control for noise and bias in those who receive it.

"Super anxious Hi everyone. So, Im freaking out right now. I'm really scared that I have HIV. I moved to a big city at the beginning of the fall for college, and I decided to try hooking up. However, it was always an instinct to use a condom when participating in sex. I've always topped too. But, I stopped after a couple months because I felt like I was doing too much. But, about a month ago, I hooked up with another dude. I've topped every dude I've had anal with and I've used a condom every time. However, I'm so scared that I have contracted HIV. I keep looking up the risks and everything. From information to ""use condoms"" to ""condoms don't always work,"" my anxiety has skyrocketed. As I type this, my cheeks and neck are red hot causing me to think I have a fever. It's more of a deep blushing feeling because my face is only affected along with my arms. But when I tell myself I'm good, my cheeks go back to normal causing me to think I'm jinxing myself. In addition, I feel a little more tired than usual.

I'm just so scared. I protected myself but I don't know if something went wrong along the way. I don't recall a condom breaking but sometimes the other dude would give the condom to me, and Im scared that they might have done something to it. I'm just so frightened. I tell myself that I should go to a nearby clinic and get tested, but what if something results that makes me fall into a depression. The semester isn't over and my life would completely change.

i finally started therapy last november because my social anxiety ha gotten too big to deal with and i feel stuck i thought it wa going well therapist understood my problem anxiety ha been my reality for year so i guess changing my mindset is a slow process and all that but a few week ago my mom told me i should try to talk with a few other therapist because she doesn t think i m not really making progress and she also doesn t like that my therapist ha suggested anxiety med and antidepressant which i m not on right now because it s like she s dismissing me she said this got me thinking that i truly don t know what the best path is because you trust your therapist you aren t the one who studied psychology so you assume she obviously know better so i thought i d try to ask people here who went to therapy and got rid of anxiety what should i expect i didn t expect my therapist to say a bunch of magic word and cure me but is it really anxiety is never going to go away you can just learn to handle it better just make yourself suffer by putting yourself in situation that cause you anxiety until you get used to it and take med to help if you want to because that s depressing i know i might sound whiny but having to make all the work myself make me lose all motivation and i just wan na off myself because i don t actually get used to stuff i ve taken the bus a million time in my life and yet i m still anxious every time i have to take it i feel like i can t win i thought that therapist would at least help a little bit because what am i paying her for telling me to accept that i can t control everything because risk is a part of life and to take a walk everyday because i could ve realized that by myself,1

"The reason I want to talk about this is because I am a *completely* different person without depression than with depression. The way I think and how I see myself is totally modified. I know this, because I experience depression in episodes, which means that on some random day I wake up and just feel normal/neutral/happy = no depression. I get a lot of blame by others for not ""focusing on the positive"" or for being mentally weak during a depressive episode, while in truth, those symptoms are all things that are directly linked to depression and it is almost *impossible* to remove them, without removing the depression.The symptoms: GUILT. I would literally feel guilty for my whole existence and everything I do or am. I become the culprit, the scapegoat, the inherently wrong one... I would have this feeling all day long. Whenever I am NOT depressed, this feeling is completely absent. LOW SELF-ESTEEM. Oh yes, that is a big one and a very obvious one. I would also not feel entitled to do certain things, because I feel like I do not deserve it. I deserve to be treated badly by others and not allowed to speak up for myself etc. It is also almost entirely absent without depression. COMPLAINING AND OVERTHINKING. I often forget that this is also directly linked to my depression. I do not really have much of a reason to overthink about things in my life and then constantly complain about stuff, which I do 24/7 while depressed. I am not able to deal with and overcome the problems I have during those episodes, whereas during no-depression I have the tools, the emotional strength and the solutions to get out of difficult situations. I encourage you to add more symptoms you experience to this list. Can we talk about the less obvious symptoms of depression?",1

I also have chronic illnesses which makes it tiring (if not at times impossible) to have to constantly fight back against all my doctors to make sure they actually treat me and my symptoms and not just the numbers on my chart. It's gotten to the point where I'm really pessimistic about getting better or even being able to get good help.",3

Recently the pain has become chronic though for three weeks now and it feels like a stabbing pain in that area that'll come in waves and is paired with back pain. Cancer is the only thing on my mind especially now that I feel like I'm prone to tumors. I'm very scared. I feel like I'll die tomorrow and nobody would notice or care since they never ask if I'm doing okay even though I'm very obviously going through something and this includes the people closest to me. I can't think about anything else and I don't know what to do besides vent about it here. ",2

"I do not know what I would do without my mom honestly my parents divorced 2 years ago and since then, my mom would manipulate me and tell me my dad was in the wrong, when she was. She cheated but refuses to admit it. It did not really matter to me at the time, and it still does not. But she lies to me about mostly everything in order to make me prefer her over my dad. The thing is I do prefer her, but I say I like them both equally. She usually leaves for a week every month to manage a restaurant far away from our home, and during this time, I feel extremely empty and meaningless for some reason. I cannot bring myself to cook food, and I just feel extremely lazy. I thought that after I got a car, I would not feel this way, but I still do. I am currently 17, and college is a year away from me, and I am scared about it because I do not want to be away from my mom. I know that I should do what is best for me, but I do not know. Is this normal? And how do I ease this strong attachment I have for her? I feel meaningless and empty without my mom near me",1

"Feeling dreadful after best friend didn't want me to come on night I know this feeling is unjust, but I can't help but feeling dreadfully anxious and sad that my best friend didn't want me at a night on the Weekend. 

I'd been excluded before in this group of friends when they went on holiday last year together. I was really upset then and just so happened to be very down at that time anyway so I ended up bringing it up and we got into a huge fight where he said he hadn't meant to and these things just happened, but also, I needed to back off.

So this weekend, he said he'd got a ticket for this night but downplayed it like it was only him and another guy and not the whole group going. But everyone from that group went. He said he hadn't known they were but I'm sure that's not true and now on reflection, they had probably planned it for months. 

I know I have no right feeling this way, people can do what they want but I can't help but feeling really sad about it, like he didn't want me there for a reason and after last time, I don't want to mention anything because I don't think he'd take it well. I know we should be able to do different things, and I'm not saying otherwise but I know everyone in this group and wonder why he didn't want me there. It's making me feel pretty low. We live together but I'm moving out next week, and a part of me is worried he'll slowly cut me out of his life. 

How can I stop feeling like this? I feel pathetic",2

"Health anxiety when sick Hi everyone,  


I've had issues with GAD for the past 10 years, it's something I've learned a lot from, and managing it usually is not terrible difficult. In late November I came down with a cold, which in turn became a sinus infection. I've had semi-noticeable issues with my sinuses for the past two years but nothing crazy, mainly decreased sense of smell, and having a stuffy nose. During this time, I became paranoid of various fatal diseases, I had a ton of different symptoms, some that can be related to sinus stuff, some anxiety things. I've had a few ups and downs throughout the last month and a bit, at one point having almost a full week anxiety free.   


Anyways, do you guys have any recommendations for dealing with HA when you have an actual medical thing going on with it's own symptoms? I am currently paranoid about some kind of Bacterial Meningitis, which, while being rational is kind of a ridiculous fear. Going to the doctor is also a bit of a challenge, I can't get a GP in my city (In Canada) and have to use health clinics. I haven't had any of the super thorough scans, tests, etc. Which also makes me a little paranoid, even though I know it's recommended not to go down that rabbit hole. I feel like my mind gets incredibly caught up in that minuscule chance that it's something serious and my ignoring it is going to be the nail in the coffin.  


  
I also just wanted to mention that I know this is a positive experience for me, even though it's kind of miserable. I don't want to be overly negative, as I have had my good days during all of this, and I try to keep positive even when things seem incredibly bleak and dreary. ",2
"Belief is single handedly the most important thing you can have in this life. Do you remember how as a kid everything felt so much more hopeful and magical so much more exciting. We often times even get nostalgic about these forgotten feelings and we are left with nothing more than a tinge of sadness after. Then you grow up and realize what a cruel and dark place the world can be, that it is not the magical place you thought it was as a kid. That- no we cannot blow a dandelion and wish to fly, that marrying a prince and becoming a princess is not the top thing on our priority list anymore, or that happily ever afters are a nonexistent reality. We realize these things and so we stop believing. We stop believing in most dreams from big ones to small ones and they are replaced instead with anxiety, fear, rejection, low self esteem, and/or depression limiting ourselves from reaching our full potential. We think our dreams are stupid now. That they are a waste of time and non realistic. But would you ever look at your four year old niece who thinks that one day she will build a blue house on a cloud and think wow this kids pretty stupid, obviously clouds are just a collection of liquid droplets which would never be able to hold the weight of a house and even if it was able to, how would you even get up to a cl no. We think this type of imagination is precious and pure, or at least I do. we used to ask why cannot I become____? But the question now becomes what is the point?. We think we are more wiser now, more logistical there is no time for childish dreaming anymore when there is work to be done to earn a living to eat sleep repeat and die. I realized one day however that the world has always been the same broken sad world that it was even when we were kids. Why is it different now? The only thing that changed is us. We stopped believing one day. Believing like a little kid again",1

"My life has pretty much been a downward spiral for 10 years now, ever since I permanently injured my right shoulder in gymnasium (European equivalent of high school).The injury is what started it all, but as time passed, my depression gradually grew into what it is today, in the beginning it was only negative thoughts about my injury, but as time passed and the negative thoughts got worse, they started seeping into every aspect of my life, until negative, downright self deprecating thoughts became the norm.I no longer feel like I am actually living my life, it feels like I am just going through the motions, most days I just feel numb and I cannot remember what it is like to wake up and be excited about the day ahead. But just to be clear, I have accepted that I do not have it in me to kill myself, but if I am going to continue living, I do not want to continue down the self destructive path I am on. As for the lying part. As of writing this, I am completely broke, on the verge of being kicked out of my apartment and I was kicked out of my university for inactivity 2 months ago and after having studied for 4 years, I am actually happy that I do not have to study anymore, since enrolling was just a thing I did, mainly to have a community to be a part of, but it did not help me and the stress of constantly studying, just added to it all.My family do not know any of this and I have been too scared to tell them all this, but now I have reached a point where I do not care anymore and am actually considering telling them about it all. Also because they keep asking me about my studies and my life in general and I just cannot keep lying about it anymore, I cannot keep track of the lies and it is tearing me apart, that this is what my life has become. I am mainly considering telling them, because I have come to the conclusion that I cannot get out of this myself and that I need help. No matter what plans I make to lessen the feeling of hopelessness they all amount to nothing, as the crushing hopelessness of it all, makes it hard must any energy to do anything but just drift along with whatever happens. I am considering just telling my parents about it all, so I do not have to lie about my life anymore.",1

This is when she told me more about her situation, basically all her issues is beacause of a very unstable family with an alcoholic, mentally abusive and neglective father. Her mom is her best friend in the world, but she too suffers from depression and anorexia. Her parents had a terrible divorce where she got caught in the middle, resulting in her falling deeper into depression and self harm tendencies, as well as her mother becoming very anorexic and depressed, all the while her father was drinking.

"My dad is a G 🔥 He has done everything for me. He has taught me everything, physical and emotional stuff.

He dropped his dreams of working as an engineer just so he can help my mom’s small business and watch over me easily

He used to smoke but quit right before I was born

He used to be in a gang in Vietnam but dropped all of that just to go to the US and start a family, he tells of how gangs of kids in their school would jump the fence and literally start fighting and shoot at each other with marbles using slingshots

He tells me stories of his childhood and how at one point at my age (18) he fought off 2 guys and defended his mom by throwing his bike at them

He is very easy-going and understanding. Street smart

He literally cooks for me every night even though I already know to cook for myself and every weekend we go camping, fishing, or etc

BUT. 

So far in my life, he has been my only friend and it feels like I failed him. I’m a nobody, I’m not smart or attractive. I’m not an ivy student. I’m mediocre with no ambition and going to community college. How can my father have this exciting life and look at me in the eye and still say he’s proud of me and loves me? How can he look at a kid who has never once been complimented by a stranger and call him handsome? Or how can he call a kid who never got a 4.0 or any academic award smart? Why does my father love me so much? It would’ve been so much easier to just end it all but he has to love me and make me stay. As I’m writing this I’ve been crying so much, I was so numb for months but suddenly during my 18th birthday and this post it’s all pouring out, it’s pathetic, I would never want him to see me like this. I’m a disgrace who will end the bloodline of smart and attractive doctors, soldiers, and farmers. No girl will want a guy who is this connected to his father, is there such a thing as a “dada’s boy”?

"My physics class is wringing me out The more weeks go by, the more helpless I feel about this course. I hate the professor, I hate the lab partners, I hate the TAs, I hate the activities and homework we have to do and I hate physics the most.

I never had a sturdy foundation in physics anyways. The only reason i managed with physics in high school was because I memorized most of the solutions and most of the problems were similar to the other problems I practiced. Besides, my tutor was good at helping me learn. 

I'm doing an introductory physics course this semester, and I feel so absolutely dumb. We're supposed to work in groups to complete activities and every week we are given a set of problems for homework. The professor adds a set of puzzles at the end of every assignment to supposedly promote logical thinking and spatial reasoning or whatever.

The thing is I never really liked physics in the first place, but not I hate it. The labs are for two hours, I can't understand a single concept and the people in my group are so snide and rude about the fact that they understand the class and I can't. I remember asking for help about a homework problem to them on Discord, and I would have been grateful if they had given me a few hints about how they solved that problem, but all they did was send the wrong answers and made a bunch of memes about how they trolled me. One of the guys is so arrogant about how he took AP Physics and he knows all of the concepts and is so good at physics.

Meanwhile I can't even do a single problem independently. The professor also gives a bunch of puzzles like kenkens or spatial reasoning problems that I'm too dumb to do and I'm doing the worst in that class. It's just too much for me. 

Aside from that course, I'm in computer science and while my other classes aren't as awful, they're also pretty difficult. Plus, I have work study, and most of my work hours coincide with the office hours. I still have to take the course as a requirement and I feel like I'm going to fail.

"I know it is so hard, to feel totally alone in the world, isolated at a disconnect. Remember that we all struggle alone, we all need people, we need people to make us feel alive, make us feel known, they become our safe place, where we run away too, who is arms we curl up and hide in. it is ok not to be ok alone. it is ok to desperately want and long for people, comfort, mutuality, touch, connection, emotion.Your not weak for that, you have not failed. it is not a societal expectations for, a neccecity, it is your want, you desire that, and you are deserved of it.I know practically it is like what do you do? But first and foremost remember in mind that your ok for wanting that, needing that. it is not an impossible ask, it is just very difficult for you right now.Friendship is a part of life, a thing that happens as you live, more people, more opportunities will come along line as you live. You have not missed your moment, this was not your one shot from which ever after you will be alone. You have the whole off your life to work on this.Just keep trying, keep working at it, learning and growing, trying to work the problems your facing, understanding what it takes for you to have the friendships that you want. Think of it as less a task, with a set end, an objective. it is exploration. People are, each and every one, ends in them selves.it is hard where your at right now, I know because I am facing something similar, I have been alone some many years now, lest some occasional offchance.

The pain is worsening and I’m so discouraged. It’s a constant burning and I can’t find any relief with a bland diet or medicine. Endoscopy and abdominal ultrasound were normal. I’m beginning to think they’ll never find out what’s wrong. It’s almost to the point I want pain medicine, and that’s not me.

I do realize the impact anxiety can have, especially on the digestive system, but I’m in constant pain. It feels like there’s more to this. I’m fearful of tests continuing to come back normal, they’ll blame my anxiety and depression and I’ll continue to suffer. Thanks for listening.

"I have been working at self awareness and often feel like I am pretty good at being self aware and trying to monitor myself. But I cannot really seem to convince anyone to spend time with me, which in all honesty I deem fair, I am often soooo anxious I cannot think of an interesting thing to do or say. And when I do speak inappropriate things get blurted and I am often as dumbstruck as my mates when I hear what I say. Some folks I know do try and it is always awkward. I have one friend from highschool who will do stuff with me but often tries to find a 3rd mate to bring (likely and understandably to cut the nervous tension). I still greatly appreciate that she tries to spend time with me even though I am awkward. I know I say weird things sometimes and I am dealing with figuring out all this repressed self hatred and sometimes it bubbles out and I am like what the heck did I just say?It feels better after ditching a few really judgmental people in my life. But I still think I need to do some growing so I can be a really good friend to the few people who have stuck with it with me. And maybe make new friends too.This is my first time posting to Reddit. Please do not trash me too hard. I cannot maintain a friendship",1

"Scared about temporal arteritis Adding to all the cancers and heart conditions I've been worried about, I just read about temporal arteritis and I'm worried about it too. I'm a 23 year old white male. For the past couple days I've had tenderness near my right temple only. There's no constant pain, but it hurts when I put mild to moderate pressure on a certain part of the bone behind/under the temple. I can feel a slight bump there but there's an essentially symmetrical one on the other side (with no tenderness with the same amount of pressure). I do have many other symptoms of temporal arteritis, including frequent headaches (although generally mild), tiredness in limbs, and general tiredness, but I've had all that for a long time and often can be traced to specific causes like poor sleeping habits and dehydration. I don't have any of the jaw pain or tiredness (any more so than I would normally get after chewing for a long time anyway), although sometimes my mouth does feel slightly stiff if I haven't opened it for a while. I do have a bad habit of clenching/grinding my teeth that I've had for most of my life, and I've had TMJ-associated pain before. I don't *think* I've had any vision loss, but sometimes I do find it harder to focus or I feel like I'm not seeing quite as well when I' tired so I can't say for sure. I don't have any other tender points on my scalp, just the right temple.",2

i need someone to tell me i’m not losing it. lately i’ve been worrying that i’m just going to have a seizure. i’ve completely convinced myself that it’s going to happen when i’m not at my house. 

yesterday i went out to eat with my parents and we were sitting in chairs at the restaurant and i leaned my head back to laugh and of course, i hit my head. at the time it didn’t feel hard enough to do anything but now it’s really worrying me. i’ve tried to avoid googling anything so i won’t further my own worries.  

my cousin has seizures  but no one else in the family does and i’m just feeling crummy about this. the rational part of my brain tells me i’m fine but the panicky/anxious part tells me not to go to school or work because you’re going to be uncomfortable and definitely have a seizure. ",2

SYMPTOMS

Left(just as much chance as the right) side of my chest has pain. It feels kind of internal and dull. It doesn't feel sharp. It comes and goes. 

I've been having these night shivers for two to three months now, where I shake uncontrollably in my legs and my feet start to sweat (sometimes hands not always). I feel better by deep breathing, but not shortness of breath, while going under the blanket to warm up. I also stick my stomach out and hold  an object against my stomach pushing into it. This happens I've noticed, when I smoke medical grade marijuana or have excessive sugar, like a unhealthy big cake slice and ice cream. It's to the point where I know when it will happen because I get a little light headed and don't feel myself and it will happen 3-5 minutes later. 

Recently, these chest pains have been occuring. I feel like I'm going to die. After it's over I just WANT to cry or die even if it's gone. 

I don't really get this from exercise. I can try again but I just ran up four flights of stairs and I feel it, but I don't have to sit down or breathe like I can't breathe. It hurts because I think about it! 

Neck pain sometimes but usually depends how I sleep. Back pain sometimes. Not really arm pain. 

My gf says no worth going to the doctor cause the bills. My dad says it's in my mind. Neither of them can physically feel what I'm feeling. As I'm typing this I'm fine but if I think about it it will come the way I explained (dull just a mild annoyance type of pain)

I'm fucking 23 and healthy. I dance, am vegetarian, sometimes work out and I really don't deserve this. It gets me SO MAD that this has randomly been happening where I'll punch my chest when it hurts just for the fact that I am so pissed off at myself for having this. It's ruining me mentally and I've always had very bad anxiety. I have panic attacks often now as well, around one a day and none if I'm lucky. I used to smoke marijuana a lot and nothing would happen, not even these panic attacks. I have recently started a career job but it's a very stressful one where I deal with public transportation and the crazyb commuters.  

Somebody please I beg to make me feel a little reassured!!!! My dad and his family have diabetes. Last time I went to the clinic three months ago, they said I was fine! No blood tests just the blood pressure arm band was used. Is this angina, anxiety, heart problems?? ",2

"When I am by myself with my thoughts I always start feeling really sad and lonely and depressed. I am an introvert(or ambivert) and I love being alone but there is also always a part of me that feels like something is missing and then I get depressed and anxious So far in the summer I have been pretty busy with my internship and hanging out with friends which means I felt this feeling less than before summer started. This for a moment made me feel that maybe my mental health was improving. However, I finished my internship last week and this week I am spending more time at home and less time with friends. My plan was to get school work done(because of procrastination, I have not) but idk I have began feeling sad again for no reason.

"Stress Relief in Making Things So last year, I went to a diner with my gf and I had myself a cappuccino for the first time. I've never tasted anything so delicious and I made it a goal to learn how to go about making one. After Christmas, I got myself an espresso machine. It would be a few months before I used it (lack of space where I live) but I finally got it set up back in November. My first drink, well... I never used a steam wand before. I watched some YouTube videos, my second cup was EXACTLY like what I had at that diner. Now I make about 3 cups a week or so (usually to keep warm more than anything) and it's expanding to where I got a coffee grinder so I'm not restricted by grind. If I want whole beans, I can work with them now. If I'm unsure what grind the bag I have is, pour some in the grinder to make sure.

Was it expensive? Well, getting everything together was about $260. With all the payment apps out there, it's affordable. You can make tons of stuff too. Lattes, mochas, I'll make hot chocolate with this thing. And I love it. If I have guests, I always offer to make them something. I found zen in the process, satisfaction in these product, and a desire to expand on what I know. It really makes me feel better knowing I can make something that not only I can enjoy, but friends and family can as well.

My advice? Learn a craft that you enjoy. If you like painting or even coloring, there's plenty of resources. If you like writing, maybe get a voice recorder for story ideas that pop up and expand on that for a bit. If you like food, all kinds of classes out there. But all in all, make something for you first.",3

"This is regarding a family member (sister-in-law)in their 30s with both physical and mental limitations on top of severe depress. They have hydrocephalus and multiple surgeries have left her with deficits both mentally and physically. She is probably cognitively equivalent to a 15 year old and has a great sense of humor and personality.Lately she has been gaining quite a bit of weight (54 and 300ish lbs) which has, in concert with her physical disabilities, made it very difficult for her to get around and she now has an even more significant risk of falling.Her mother does not purposefully enable her and is an excellent care taker but putting her on a diet is next to impossible because she is very picky and has been known to self harm if she does not get her way. Its safe to assume she has around six sodas a day. Switching to diet is not an option in her mind and The only alternative for drinks is juice and for sugar Gatorade. I am concerned she will become diabetic if she is not already. Another serious concern is that her mother will no longer be able to provide care for her if she cannot move her. Her mother is in her 60s and has her own health issues. She very regularly strained her back trying to help her daughter off the ground or couch. Even navigating the world with her daughter in a wheelchair is physically difficult for her mother.Does anyone have any tips, success stories, advice on how to approach this? I love her tremendously and I am concerned about her quality of life if we do not change the path we are on. we have considered the fact that if things do not turn around we may have to find an institution for her but she has so many medical problems that it would be difficult to arrange and it would be a total betrayal of trust.

Not only that, I have been wanting to hangout with one of my favorite coworkers but he keeps blowing me off. that is the one thing I liked to do and I just wanted to blow off steam and shoot the shit with him but he just keeps blowing me off and canceling on me. I have been asking like a week in advance to do something, he oks it, then suddenly he randomly invites someone else and they take over, basically ruining everything for me. Then this weekend is not good, how about next weekend? Next weekend comes and its still not good. Any shred of hope and happiness that I barely have gets taken away from me. Its not just hanging out with my coworker, its like I said, work. I get happy for a split second and I think I am almost at the top, then I get knocked down. I think I am going to blow off steam with my coworker and he keeps canceling on me. He probably never wants to hangout again but whatever. I do not care. Am I that awful/annoying to the point where he does not want to hangout anymore?? I considered him an older brother/mentor/best friend. Not so much anymore. My life has been so shitty lately that I got a slight injury last Saturday and did not start feeling better until yesterday. I could have gone to work but I just did not feel like it. That place depresses me and my coworker is not helping. I was already feeling down and I thought that maybe my coworker and I could hangout like we used to. I was really looking forward to it. Nothing was set in stone but it felt like this weekend would have been a good one. But I guessed wrong. I hate my life and and I just wish I could go away and never come back!! I know I have other friends and coworkers to hangout with but I have different relationships with different people, everybody does, so that is why its disappointing when someone you thought you were close to blows you off and is basically meh and cold towards you. I need a fucking vacation or something. I am just over feeling down and depressed. I hate it!! The one person that thought I clicked really well with is just been so off and distant with me. My life is just one big disappointment after another",1
Good day. I am from the Philippines and I was recently diagnosed with Depression and Anxiety almost a month ago (July 10th). Since then it has been a very challenging and difficult time for me and my family. Work required me to secure a fit to work order before I can get back to work. My medical insurance does not cover mental health conditions and it took me over 3 weeks to secure one.,3
"I have tried really hard to stick it out and be positive. But I feel like the universe has given up on me. And it never felt like there was anyone for me anyways. So maybe all of this is a sign that this is it. I do not need to keep fighting and holding on any longer. I can finally rest and be at peace. I do not need to swim against the current. Just let it take me wherever, as long as I do not have to feel again.I am so tired. I do not need to keep going. I am broken and I want to say goodbye to anyone who will listen",1

"Its become pretty hard to sleep at night. Feeling as if my demons are watching over me and preventing the happiness that I used to feel. I sit and stare into myself, deeply with the mirror across from me. Realizing I am not the same person I used to be. Feeling as if I am lost and alonefeeling of desperation for that happiness I cannot even seem to remember. I cannot the control feelings that have been driving me crazy. The feelings that make me feel heavy, dark and lost. Almost as if my mind is unable to be cured from myself. I know it is all mental, all in my head and my own doingyet I cannot escape it. Almost as if I am torturing my own self for whatever lies below. I know there are people out there that have this same issue, plenty, yet why do I feel so alone? Why do I feel as if I cannot help myself. I am stronger than this and I know that yet why do I feel so weak? This will not be the end of me. So I must suffer or figure it out but I will not let it ever win. I will not be on of the many defeated. I will push on, keep motivated that there will be light at the end of the tunnel, that there will be that desired treasure we all have been craving. Many hide the shame associated with these feelings, myself included. Many do not know how I feel or how much it truly bothers me, but I will push on. I have shared to those that I know will support. I have found I am not alone after all. It does get better. I am doing much better now than I was months ago, let alone years ago. Maybe I have been looking at this all wrong? Maybe do not look for an escape, do not look for a way out, but to look for a way to cope. A way to look at the brighter side. A way to live in one with these demons, with these tortures and all as it is part of life. It is what we cast upon ourselves due to whatever we have going on. Whether it is our fault or not, we must coincide with these feelings and use them to power ourselves on. I will not lose, I will win this war. Anxiety",1

"Is it helpful to reassure those suffering from HA? I’m seeing so many threads on here discussing symptoms and asking whether the symptoms are possibly cancer, heart disease, *insert other terrifying illness.* I suppose I’m wondering if it is actually helpful to answer these threads and reassure these people? It just feels like the poster might get some reassurance, feel better for awhile and then just turn their attention to another illness, never actually dealing with their anxiety. I think reassuring these posters and even encouraging them to see the doctor is not helping address what really is the root problem here.",2

"depression on drugs Simple question for people with depression. How do you feel on alcohol or other drugs, if so which drugs? How often do you use them? Do you believe it affects you depression in any way, long term, short term? 

I'm interested in any answer from a person who uses drugs on how it affects their depression. But particularily people who don't use them regularly: does it make you feel happiness? Does it make you feel things you miss out on in daily life? Why don't you keep using them? (of course know a lot of good reasons not to use drugs in daily life even if you're depressed, I'm just interested in the answers)",1

"I feel like the last four years were just a big scam. College did not give me any new prospects and it gave me \~$30,000 in debt plus \~$60,000 of parent plus loans for my immigrant mom who does not even know that she took out those loans becuse she cannot speak or read english.I have an awesome girlfriend but she lives in another country on the other side of the world and we have not met in person yet. I promised her that we would meet this summer but covid changed our plans. I need to find some entry level job so I can start paying off this massive loan but it just looks so hopeless. I am thinking of getting 2 jobs, maybe one in retail and one at an Amazon warehouse but even then it would take me forever to pay them off. If I cannot live with or even visit my girlfriend then maybe I am not the right guy for her. At this point I am just a financial burden for my parents; not to mention a massive dissapointment. I have two younger brothers and I feel like they will learn from my massive errors and do the right thing after high school. But I do not think there is any hope for me anymore. Just graduated college and feel like my life is reaching an expiration date",1

"I made this account because I have no one else, or nowhere else to vent to. I need an outlet, and I guess an anonymous site like this works best. So I was diagnosed with depression recently, which is not a surprise to me, I sort of knew I had it anyway but now it is officially diagnosed. Some days are okay, but a lot of days just seem to be impossible. I am speaking with my doctor about therapy, and from what I have heard, anti-depressants could be an option in the future. I would rather deal with this head on rather than being medicated, but I am glad to know that there is always that option. Basically, I just want to vent here about how this is affecting me. I am finding little to no joy in my ""happy"" activities. Playing Minecraft, or watching Modern Family for the 50th time, just does not seem to help me anymore. I have two dogs that I love more than anything, but even seeing their wagging tails is doing little to break the numbing sensation I feel. I just hope this gets easier. My first session with my therapist will be next week, so maybe I will update when that happens. Either way, I know I am not alone, so it is nice to have a space like this to vent to. Hopefully you guys will understand. God, this is getting hard to deal with",1

"I am about to turn 18 and I am not ready. I never planned on getting this far, living this long. That selfish desire to end it all is still there but I am too afraid to do it. I look back at 15 year old me, feeling almost the exact same way, and wish I would had the guts to do it then. If I had not taken years to dwell on it, years in which I have acheived absolutely nothing, done absolutely nothing, I might have been able to rest and find peace so much sooner. I felt like I have not slept in years, my relationship with food is only more horrendous and the only thing that forces me outside is an exercise addiction. Whatever momentary happiness I might feel when I watch a good film, or see a fox in the evening, does not make any of this worth it. I have not felt true joy in so long, I do not think I even remember what it means to actually enjoy life.I have completely wasted my teenage years. I have spent them inside for the most part, isolating myself from people and trying to sort myself out on my own. I cut people off, and other people got bored and left, and now my only good friends live thousands of miles away and I will probably never even get to meet them. I know this is my fault, and I should have tried harder to connect with people, but I just could not. It felt impossible to hold onto those who mattered. Now I watch them all, on Instagram, going about their lives and having a great time, and I am so happy for them, but I am also so selfishly jealous. That happiness they have is all I have ever wanted. If I could throw away everything I have, but be free from mental illness, I would do it in a heartbeat. I am so exhausted. I do not even know what I am doing anymore. I am about to turn 18 and I have wasted my teenage years",1
"Rewilding Helped Me Beat Health Anxiety Hey guys, my personal experience with health anxiety came from seemingly nowhere. One day I had chest pain, and then every day for months after that I dug myself deep into this dark chasm that is health anxiety. At my lowest, I was up till 4 am on WedMD every night, almost got fired from my job, and most importantly - living in chronic PHYSICAL pain.   


The TLDR of my story is that rather than seeking ""comfort"" (hot baths, heating pads, painkillers), I began to seek ""discomfort"" and that led me to what I now understand as ""rewilding"".   


Basically, you are reaffirming your body how strong and capable you really are, by exposing yourself to elements that we humans previously had to deal with constantly....long before the days of anxiety lol.   


Take some cold showers. Go out into the elements for at least 20 minutes a day. Develop a deeper relationship with your breath.   


If anyone is interested in more information on this, I'll happily write an article, but I'm not an expert, just a practitioner. The man responsible for the term is [Daniel Vitalis](http://www.danielvitalis.com/rewild-yourself-podcast/).   


But there are others doing similar stuff, such as Wim Hof.   


Reaffirming to myself that I am strong was the only thing that pulled me out, and it started with seeking discomfort, learning some stoicism, and severing the emotional attachment I had to my physical symptoms. You can do it too.   


Love

"I feel like everything nice and fun just ceases to exist. it is like it is my fault that I am trying too hard to be happy and everything gets worse.My few and only ""best friends"" are toxic and manipulative, bringing up stuff from years ago that they know make me feel guilty. My parents are abusive and give me little to no privacy, wanting my exact location and email password and forcing me in social situations, knowing that they make me uncomfortable, just so I get used to it.My favorite game is being put on fucking live support, Youtube videos are boring and uninteresting, just everything that I used to pass the time is unbearable.None of the pathetic little ""projects"" I start do not go anywhere, because it is hard to do anything at this point.And I feel guilty that I have brought all of this on myself by being an awful person my whole life. Do I deserve this? Have I made others' lives miserable and I just did not know? Am I annoying? Insufferable? I feel guilty when someone is doing something and I am just too tired to help.Maybe my friends are not toxic, nor my parents, nor is anything bad happening. Maybe I am toxic, complaining about my miniscule problems that nobody gives a shit about. Maybe. I hope not.The only thing I have going for me is that I recently found this person, they seem very nice, and I wish we can be friends, but we have talked for 2 days about an hour per day and I already fear she will reject me, because I kind of think she is just being nice to a stranger, and because I think I blew it by saying ""I actually have nothing to say, it is just nice to talk to you"".

"Late night thoughts Being high functioning is really draining. 
I can uphold a mask of normality for a period of time, but Jesus Christ is it exhausting. 
In the presence of people, I act. I convince them that I’m fine, I begin to convince myself too. And for a few moments sometimes I forget. Sometimes.
Until I get into bed and I’m staring at the ceiling, feeling an empty sense of longing for God knows what. Why do I feel like something’s missing? 
Emptiness engulfs me at the realisation of the futility of it all. Life.
My body aches, my eyes burn and I just want to be unconscious. 
And I think to myself, is this all that there is?

Most of my life, I’ve felt this dark presence lurking in the corner of my mind. Like a feral black dog following me around, just hungrily waiting to devour me. I somehow always manage to find strength to keep moving, but it always follows. 
Sometimes, I just greet it, and lay down in despair.

But also need to continue paying for life in general i.e. food, bills, car.I screwed myself by letting things get to me and not voicing my opinion.

Muscle twitches Please help I’m going crazy. Ever since the beginning of December I’ve been having muscle spasms and they’ve gotten worse... I try to tell myself that it’s just anxiety but I’m really afraid that it’s not :( I only notice them when I’m at rest (sitting or laying down) and I don’t think I have muscle weakness ... just really tired and haven’t really been working out. But the muscle twitches ARE ALL OVER MY BODY literally in places I didn’t think I could have them... I’m just really scared it’s als. I have a lot going on so I haven’t gone to the doctor I’m going tomorrow though.. hopefully I will get some answers ,2
"Where do I begin to get help? I'm a 27 year old female. I've probably had anxiety all my life but have never spoken to a doctor or anyone about it. 

I feel like im just always in a constant state of worry. So much so that it drives me to have small OCD traits. Something as simple as fearing a house fire and having to do a series of steps checking lights before I leave the house. Over and over......and over again. It's weird. 
 
I'm always worrying about the future, past things I can't change, things I say or do after im with people, how people view me, if I have a ""too much"" gene. I'll sit and agonize over things that's so mild for someone to worry about but drives me up a wall. To the point of frustration where I just lose it and cry into a panic. 

I dont even know where to start to solve this. I feel like the past year it's been horrendous and getting increasingly worse. I'm good at playing it off. I'm good at putting on a show because I've always thought I could handle it- lots of people I know feel the same. But it's really starting to take a toll on my life and the things I'm doing or too afraid to even try to do.

I feel like I use alcohol and drugs as a way to cope sometimes. Not an outrageous amount but I'll have a big drinking night and then will go a week without drinking cause I've worried myself into thinking I have a problem and need self control. 

I'm so good at people pleasing and acting like everything is fine but I feel like my mind is just in a dark place. Telling myself I'll never make it, that I'll always be alone, etc.

It's really stupid things to stress over. Or at least stupid things to let myself worry about for more than a minute. 

Money is always a bug stress factor- for everyone of course but thats the main reason I think I've never gone to get help. I'm not sure how much it cost to afford the help I need or where to even go. Not to mention the fear I get trying to explain how I feel to someone and them thinking I'm crazy or I'm making it up- how sad to think a professional in this field would judge me....

I just feel like if I dont try to improve my overall mindset towards life then I wont have a fulfilling one. I'll be too afraid to try new things that scare me, I'll stick to my same safe routine, and I'll come home and cry over the big and small worries that run through my head daily. 

Where I do I start to fix this...?",2

"18F and I am starting college in about a month or so. I have struggled with depression since middle school as well has being diagnosed with a chronic immune deficiency and B/P ED. I love animals, I actually went vegan to help with the fatigue and pain from my illness and stayed that way after learning of the benefits for animals. I live with my parents because my fianc is half way across the world ( mil and together 5 years ) and our wedding is not for another year. I have been quite lonely without him here because we were together every day. Its made me struggle with both my depression and eating disorder. Especially starting college soon and having only one close friend. My parents have two chihuahuas but I have two younger siblings so you can see where the dogs are not really with me. I have my own larger space in the house. I think having a my own companion could help me through these times.

"I can't cry anymore I have so many thoughts and emotions i want to get out somehow but I can't even cry, I feel so numb.",1
"On the Here and Now Looking out at a beautiful spring day I find myself buried in anxiety.  Thoughts crash into my mind

“*I’ve lost weight recently, what if it’s the beginning of the end”*

*“I feel dizzy, oh god there’s something wrong I know it”*

*“What if I stop looking and miss an important symptom?”*

&amp;#x200B;

I am so fucking tired of this.  We spend so much of our day worrying about the future or ruminating on our past.  But we have *only* now.  Our consious mind doesn’t inhabit the future or the past, it inhabits this very moment.  Right. Now.  

And right now I don’t want to feel anxious.  Don’t get me wrong, I don’t want to feel anxious ever but I can only change that *right now*.  The best part?  The more I change that right now, the easier it will be to change that for future me.  

&amp;#x200B;

So starting right now I’m going to:

1. **STOP GOOGLING (and body checks).**  My doctor once told me I have “googleitis” and the best and only cure was to just stop.  Helpful advice there.    
Obviously go to your doctor if you're worried about something, and by all means, get a second opinion if you're still concerned.  Beyond that, leave it to the professionals to diagnose.  
2. **Stop seeking reassurance for every symptom.**  I know what people are going to say to me.  “You’re fine”, “Statistically that only has a 0.00001% chance”, “breathe deeply”.  I can do this for myself.  I can be kind and firm with my own mind.  
3. **Stop asking “what if”**.  Things can and will happen.  Worrying about the future will never help.  We can only live our best lives now, and take life as it comes.
4. **Actually acknowledge statistics.**  Next time I feel a symptom I’m going to ask myself “what’s the most likely cause?”  Pretty much any symptom can be better attributed to harmless things like lack of sleep, too much coffee, too much anxious thinking, and so on.
5. **Recognize and challenge maladaptive thought patterns.** The more I think in anxious ways, the more my brain will automatically go back to those patterns.  Time to see those thoughts for what they are: unrealistic beliefs and fears.  

&amp;#x200B;

I know anxiety is going to get worse at the start, but I can handle that.  

&amp;#x200B;

I can do this.  So can you.  ",2

"Recently after a few changes in my life (new job, new apartment) I have been experiencing this new kind of depression that revolves around an urge to do more. I have struggled with my mental health for most of my life and over the course of the last year felt an overwhelming fear of death after losing a family member (common I heard.)This new feeling is a sort of numbness where suicidal thoughts have started to transform into a step to find my full potential. I want to work out more, go see things all in the face of this means nothing, what if I just floated along? I feel as if now I am not living so suicide will not change much, but now this isolation and numbness feels like preparation for self-identification or my body and mind fearing for itself.Am I feeling these urges to live out of fear of losing it? Is this a desperate attempt to feel something? Am I just all jumbled up because of the changes in my life? I am going to try to figure this out with doctors but that is what my questions to myself are becoming. I go to therapy, I am on meds. I do not know what this is and I am mostly trying to see if anyone has felt something similar to this gibberish as I try to figure it out myself. This is super weird and very tough to explain I am realizing as I type this. Thanks. Weird Numbness Depression. (Has anyone felt this?)",1

"Paresthesia I have this nagging tingling sensation on the left side of my scalp and face. I have gotten MRIs, CT scans and everything is normal. Doctors don’t seem too concerned about it. And I have them even if I am relaxed and meditating. Anyone has this feeling/sensation?",2

I’m also anxious about many other silly things and it affects my daily life so badly. I feel like a failure. I’m really depressed. I wish I could just disappear forever. Every day I just wish that I could never wake up again.

I wish I looked more like a normal person so people won’t notice me and talk about me.",1

"I do not know if some of you remember me, but I did a post a few days back here -&gt; [Can we talk about the less obvious symptoms of depression?]( summarized now all the symptoms you have written down in the comment section. Why I do it is because for years I was beating myself up for those less obvious symptoms, because I was not aware that it goes hand in hand with depression and thought I was simply mentally and emotionally weak, compared to everybody else. Since I had this epiphany that it might be directly associated to depression, I understand my mind much better, which I find to be helpful for myself. This leads me to have more compassion for myself and knowing, that this is not necessarily who I am. It has often been pointless trying to solve those problems (which I was trying to do for years), because as long as I am/was depressed, there was literally *nothing* I could do about those less obvious symptoms. it is like working hard for having no results, and then hating myself for not making any progress at all. So I hoped to help some of the people here too.Disclaimer:This list does not serve to be self-diagnosed and many of the points do not have to have anything to do with depression.Again: these are the LESS OBVIOUS SYMPTOMS. So for example sadness, exhaustion, numbness or lack of appetite are not listed, since those would be the better-known symptoms.&amp;#x200B;COGNITIVE ABILITIES* Memory loss * Reduced focus capacity* Problems with learning * Catatonia * Less intelligent* Inability to read* Derealization / Dissociation* Negative change in executive functioning EMOTIONS + FEELINGS* Indecisiveness (even for the smallest and less important decisions) * Shame / feeling embarrassed* Guilt* Bitterness* Irritation / anger* Anxiety* Impulsiveness * Frozen (emotionally, mentally and physically)* Restless * Overwhelmed by the smallest things (emotionally, mentally and physically) SELF IMAGE* Low self-esteem * Self-loathing* Everything is my fault* Loss of identity * Fixating on physical appearance * Consistent and relentless negative self talk* Self-doubt* Imposter-syndrome PHYSICAL* Sexual impotence / asexual / very low libido* Insomnia / sleeping issues / sleep deprivation* Lack of hygiene * Losing sense of taste* Gastrointestinal symptoms * Physical aches * Physical discomfort * Headaches / Feeling like an anchor pushes on your head * Sensitive to noises * Acne, hair loss, lower back pain &amp; irregular periods (&lt;- this could be symptoms of something else, e.g. hormonal) SOCIAL* Lower social intelligence * Not being able to handle criticism * Sensitivity to rejection* Grudge holding* Decreased ability to read social ques or properly display emotions * The need for company + not having energy to be social* Wanting people to know(or notice) that you are depressed / the need for compassion* Envy of people * Not wanting to be a burden to others isolating* Hating people / misanthropy * Being rude to others OTHERS* Burnout * Overthinking* Complaining* Remember all childhood experiences and overanalyzing them * Identifying with depressed famous people and romanticizing own situation and wanting to put own negative thoughts into artwork* Never being in the moment* Not caring about the future* Exaggeration of own bad situation Comprehensive list of the less obvious symptoms of depression",1

"I am 19. I am extremely depressed by the reality of adulthood. I just feel like even if I suffer in silence on the inside, nobody cares. But I know people do care but I am finally beginning to realise ""Only you can control your life"". I have serious hair fall. No appetite most of the days. I am forcing myself to eat. I mostly sleep really late at night. So when I wake up late, I feel like I already failed this day. My teeth are stained weirdly. I cannot smile without feeling insecure. I cannot imagine going out the facing the world after the pandemic ends.I used to be so full of dreams. Now I just feel empty. I feel like a stranger to myself. I spend my days thinking all the worst possible scenarios like if I am going to go bald or my teeth is going to fall ( My front teeth fell three years ago because of an accident. I am very insecure about my teeth since then)I am trying to get better and trying to build better habits but I always go back to my bad ways. I feel like I am stuck in a loop. No matter how much I try, I cannot seem to break free. It just seems hopeless. The isolation does not help either. I just feel like I should be this ""energetic person who lives every day to the fullest"" or I am a failure. Just need to get this off my chest",1

I will just sit on the couch or the floor with them while they play but my mind is either on overdrive or just so tired.

"Since I was maybe 16 or 17 everyone kept asking when I am getting a job and what not. Yes I get it I am in college and I need to pay off loans nd shit. But look at it from my pov. I did not have the right equipment till now. Now that I do I have no motivation to even do what I want in life. It never ends with them. I am just trying to make myself feel better but they keep asking every fucking time we see each other. I just want a summer to myself without it. They call me lazy and it hurts. Physically yeah sure ill agree. But when I am working on projects I am 100% doing my work. No sleep, all panick, get depressed do not eat work go to class repeat. I do not ever get to just really relax and not feel like shit mentally. To everyone elses pov they think I am slacking off vegging out or being lazy. If you think I am that lazy then why am I in college constantly panicking about getting shit done. I am already having a hard year I do not need this. It just makes me want to lay in the street and wait to get crushed. I already cannot get out another loan when I am a year and a half left. I am trying to let go but everyone is making it harder on me. I try pleasing everyone else but myself. For once this summer I wanted to without feeling guilty. But yet I cannot have that either.

"My partner just came home so angry he immediately left to work out. I feel so bad. I feel this is my fault Needing a rant, and maybe support from people who have been through similar

I guess this is a rant? Or maybe just asking if people have been in similar situations.

Edit to add, I'm in Scotland. 

So I've been off work for a year now with severe MH, had 2 S attempts and multiple SH requiring hospitalisation last year. 

I'm on duloxetine 120mg for severe depression, underactive thyroid which I take lebothyroxine for,I have narcolepsy and take 200mg modafinil for that, and I have a blood disorder (cancer?) Currently undergoing tests. All these things major symptom is chronic exhaustion but I also have chronic pain (R knee operated on 2020 and currently waiting on L knee op), we're querying fibromyalgia. 

I applied for ADP in November last year, and submitted my part 2 in December. 
I submitted as part of my supporting evidence a short patient summary from my GP, my medication list (Inc up to date prescription repeats forms), letters from my therapist, letters from the police (involvement after S and severe SH), letters from my mental health team, letters from psych, and a letter from my GP detailing all above and support. 

I've heard nothing from ADP so today went to online chat and was told it's been picked up by a case manager (yay) , but that they've requested more SI from my GP. 

What?!?!?

What else could they need? And if they've requested that from GP it'll take months before I hear. It took my GP 5 months just to write the support letter they did write. 

So now I'm in an anxiety spiral because if they're gonna deny my claim I wish they would just fucking tell me instead of making me wait 6+months. All the while I can't afford my mortgage and I'm getting deeper and deeper in debt.

"A little rant I hope this would reach someone to make them feel less lonely. 
I am studying constantly to finish my bachelors degree by time, and when I say constantly I mean from 12am to 12pm, with 10 mins of break every hour, and with the breaks needed to eat. Then I start to follow my interests by watching videos on yt, and I end sleeping every night at 4/5am (that’s why I start studying that late in the morning). In the meanwhile, my mom’s getting old and dad is emotionally far (they divorced). My mom is almost every day stressed and sad (for reasons that can be acceptable and sometimes unacceptable), and I don’t know how to talk with my dad, because I don’t feel him as a “real” father, due to some things that happened in the past but which I can’t actually forget. 
At the same time, my gf is pretty stressed with her life since October 22, and despite the fact that things are still fine, I feel the stress that is infiltrating in our relationship; my best friend are day by day more emotionally far than ever, and I genuinely don’t know what to do.

"I feel like my psychologist might be ready to refer me elsewhere I have OCD with a health anxiety emphasis. My worries have run the gamut but I mostly focus on the idea of skin cancer. I have been seeing a psychologist for CBT and while in the sessions everything he says sounds logical and makes perfect sense. However, the second I encounter a mole I feel looks suspicious I don't apply what I've learned in therapy and I do everything wrong. I start by googling my symptoms and then when that doesn't work, I go to my doctor to seek reassurance. This assuages my fears temporarily but sometimes its not enough until the doctor will agree to a biopsy. Then inevitably the cycle continues.

My psychologist has been doing this therapy with me for months and I was doing so well until I tried testing myself and found a new mole. I was definitely not ready for it and this started a downward spiral where I feel like all the progress I made went by the wayside and I was back to how I was in the beginning.

Today I had a session after my most recent urgent care &amp; doctor visit. The tone was a lot different this time and I can tell he's frustrated with me because I am not using his advice. He kept saying, ""I am sorry that I haven't been able to get through to you to help you."" and has pointed out that I am not doing the work of not giving into my compulsions. He said that he didn't want to make me go through therapy if I wasn't motivated to do the work to get better. He's totally right. 


The positive that came out of this is that I am reflecting on my lack of motivation to do what I know I need to do to get better. I feel like I can prove myself to him from this point forward but I don't know that he's willing to continue treating me. Hopefully this next appointment isn't him telling me its the last one. Anyway, thank you for reading!",2

I just get annoyed, I have violent impulses when never in my life I have been a violent person, on the contrary I'm always super peaceful and conciliatory. But now at any inconvenience I want to break windows, I want for people to stop calling me ""resilient"", I want to punch walls and scream. 

My therapist which was great at teaching me how to deal with things in healthy manners, now seems annoying and making me feel like being upset is not ""healthy"" and it might not but at this point I'm exhausted of feeling sad or defenseless or disappointed.",1

"On July 2 I had my first hosted birthday since maybe the age of 6 or 8. I was gifted 700 dollars worth of money and two book cases. I felt awful accepting all the money but deep down I really wanted it. The reason being I wanted to spend it all on pretty things.This past month of July I have been browsing at things to buy online, things that can help fill up the book cases. But before July, June, I was feeling depressed and had suicidal thoughts, and I have had those thoughts and feelings since I can recall, maybe the last five months but more noticeably, the last three. Anyway, the point is that this past month I have been buying things, getting attached to thing that I have not yet bought, only to want to buy them. Since I have the money I have seen it as an easy thing to do. The problem is that I have noticed that ever since I started buying things I have not had any suicidal thoughts. Which I see as a good thing? I am happy?I find it fucked up how buying things is all I can think about, just the other day I watched the mailman get off and on the truck and drive away just to grab the box they left. Its like my life revolves around it. Two days ago i really wanted to buy things worth over 140 dollars, my mom said no, not knowing I had spent 200 dollars prior. She said that I should be spending the money on clothes and stuff that I need. Ever since then I have been sulking about it, wanting so badly to buy more things. And things I want to buy are useless and are only for display purposes besides some books. I tell myself that its my birthday money, and that I can help myself with spending it on whatever I want. And in reality I know deep down that I should not be buying these things? I hate falling for consumerism and basically numbing myself with all these things I want to buy and put in my room. I do not see it as an addiction but more of an escape. I might be delusional and maybe I was never depressed, but if these suicidal thoughts come back what do I do then.

"I continue to struggle with meaning and each success seems to bring with it failure and upheaval in my basic needs which stresses me out more and makes me less hopeful about a stable future for myself. I accept that much of my depression stems from getting off of certain drugs and that leading to my seratonin system being off kilter, and I am trying to do things to fix that, like working towards getting on an antidepressant but it just feels like I cannot do anything right and I keep endangering my basics. Like I was kind of down 2 weeks ago, which was exacerbated by a gout flareup which took my ability to walk away for a week. At the end of that flare, just as I had gotten on meds to stabilize my uric acid levels so I could walk, I had a relapse on painkillers and messed up a shared bathroom, leading to leakage in the apartment below and to my imminent eviction from my place (as soon as possible by the end of the month). I am crossing my fingers that the woman whose upstairs area I was planning to move in at the last week of August let us me move in early, and I quickly put an end to my relapse and have an appointment for vivitrol next week (the relapse was at the end of a vivitrol cycle), but it is difficult not to get down on myself, especially as the prospect of homelessness quickly approaches and I only recently managed to free myself of that condition. I just feel like a fuck up, am afraid that I will keep facing this failure repeatedly. I am trying and will not give up anytime soon, but continue to remain frustrated by my continued accrual of consequences which keep adding stress. I do not know. I hope you are having a better week/month/year/life than I am. Keep on keeping on. I hope I can stop making my life more difficult soon. it is frustrating and depressing.",1

Everyone tells me that better things are going to happen soon, do not give up, you will get there, blah blah blah. it is all repetitive and I am honestly done hearing that bullshit. I have gone through group therapy, intensive therapy, and I see my own therapist and I think I am just done. If anything, I just want someone to listen right now. Maybe someone might tell me something different. You know, it was way better to make up excuses when I was sad about something, but what happens when I do not feel anything at all? &amp;#x200B;Anyway, thanks for reading. I do not feel anything. Is this depression?",1

"Doctors notes/records Hi just wondering if anybody knows about if doctors think you are drug seeking do they put that on your record? 
I went to doctors yesterday, didn’t see my usual GP, it was about spinal pain that radiates up my back, only seems to hurt after physical activity which is weird but concerning to me. The day before appointment I went gym &amp; done some light training on back muscles which really set it off, was painful &amp; felt weird afterwards like weakness in my arms, bit dizzy and just a general weak feeling like really weak and disorientated. She was not helpful at all, basically done a quick op’s check, checked my back briefly &amp; said it seems ok. She said to rest on weekend and see how I go, she said hot water bottle. The more im thinking about my appointment with a her yesterday I get the impression she feels I was drug seeking. I never asked for any drugs but I feel she was misunderstanding me being concerned with trying to get drugs. She said something when I sat down like “you’re looking to discuss pain management” I didn’t really take it in as was really anxious and tired so I said yeah about my spine then proceeded to talk about my concerns, but not once did I say anything about wanting medications/drugs. I’m annoyed now I should of been clear that I would of liked a referral to be checked out or something. I’m on pregabalin for anxiety (it also just happens to be a nerve pain drug) and she said few times about you’ll have review soon with usual GP to see if it’s helping my anxiety and not just about pain management. She also said you’ve only upped dosage 10 days ago. I didn’t really take it in properly at the time but I feel she thinks I was trying to up my dose or get pain meds? I’m worried now that it will be on my notes and I’m also frustrated that I didn’t correct her properly. Any advice or help on this would be appreciated im very anxious about this, I feel I was totally misunderstood and I don’t like the thought of her putting on notes I was looking for pain management or medication to help that. I also noticed as I was leaving she done a frustrated sigh. This experience has made me feel invalidated, misunderstood and made my anxiety and depression worse. I’m struggling mentally very very bad to say the least.",2

"I have days when my body feels extremely heavy and the only way I know how to let go of that weight is to have a mini crying session. it is weird because my brain thinka that is perfectly legitimate but it quickly spirals away and here I am bawling away for hours and hours. Feels like it drained the life out of me. I know I need to stop for a second and really think what is making me upset and try to understand it better or fix it. But I just feel so tired. So tired. I do not wish to think or evaluate anything, and I rationalize it by saying that I am really really tired.I feel like I lose a part of myself everytime this happens. So much so that I doubt if I will ever be able to pick up all these pieces of myself ever again.Anyone else feels/felt this? How do you get around it? Is it normal to cry for hours and hours?",1

"I don't know what to do. I don't know how to do it. I don't know where I am. I don't know where I'm going. By tomorrow night, I (21 y/o UK university student) have to email my dissertation supervisor a draft of what I have written so far; the deadline is in May and he wants to give me some feedback before the upcoming Easter break. But the problem is that I haven't written anything. At all. I've collated dozens of pages of general notes, vague ideas and research over the last few months, but I don't have a clue what to do with it, or where to start.

I've written probably hundreds of assessments and essays in my life, and until a few weeks ago, I had not failed a single one of them. But a few weeks ago, my motivation, self-belief and general ability to work (which were all low to begin with anyway) just stopped altogether. I had deadlines for two course module assessments within a week of each other, and I missed both of them. For one of the first times in my education, I had not only failed with work, but I had failed to even complete the work. I missed the first one because I had zero interest in, knowledge of or care for the subject, because I kept procrastinating, and because it's possible that I have ADHD (I don't want to know about this, but I think I have it). I missed the second one because of the same reasons, and because I failed the first one, so it didn’t make a difference if I missed the second one.

Since I got the email last week from my supervisor that I have to send him whatever I've been working on by tomorrow (Tuesday), I've not only not been working on the dissertation, but I've detached myself from it almost completely. I don’t like thinking about it. I keep distracting myself from it (literally and mentally) because I don't want to do it. The subject itself interests me (it was my choice after all) and i’ve done a lot of research (too much I think) and every time I ever doubt my work ability like this (which is every time i’ve ever done an assessment in my three years at university) it usually turns out alright, but I can't see how this one — of course, the most important one — will end in anything other than failure. So I’ve come all this way — from the start of uni three years ago, from the start of reception 17 years ago — and I've always, at the very least, managed to succeed. But now of all times is when it stops.

I’m aware that every student who has ever tried to write a university thesis has had these doubts at some time, or a lot of the time. But that makes me feel all the more incapable. Because those students have all, and will all, get through it, and I know that I won't. I look around the university library that I'm currently writing this in, and all I see is people working; they’re focused, self-disciplined, and content to be here. But I’m not one of them. I know that I don’t belong here, and I don’t like it here. I really don't like coming here. But I come here nevertheless. I'm sitting here wasting more time on something that I don't have to do, that I shouldn't be doing, but I'm doing nevertheless. Because I think a part of me actually wants to fail. I don't know why anyone would want that, especially me; I've always feared failure — the confirmation of it by my university and parents; the consequences of it practically and emotionally — and that's what’s driven me to always succeed with my work in education. I've only ever done that work because I fear the consequences of not doing it. I do it because I have to, never because I wanted to. I've always been like this.

So why am I here then? If you never enjoyed school or college (which i didn't) then why did you actively decide to go to university? Hmm. Maybe because I thought I had to (not because I wanted to pursue a career — I have absolutely no ambition at all). And it was partly because the idea of getting a job after I left college at 18 seemed completely impossible (I've suffered from social anxiety for most of my life; the basics of social interaction are overwhelming to me). But mostly, it was because I didn't think any of it through. I didn't want to think it through at all. My parents thought I could maybe go to this university, so I just said okay. I didn't even look into the university at all, and I didn't consider any others. The reason that I do this is because I hate thinking about the future — short, medium and long term. Whenever people ask me about the future, whether it’s “where do you see yourself in five years”, “what do you want to do with your life"" or even simply “do you have any plans for the weekend”, I’ve always given vague non-answers. I've been like this forever. Probably because I’ve been bombarded with these questions from career advisors since Year 1. But it's also because the future is too uncertain and complicated. It scares me to think about the future in any sort of way. So I don't. And now I'm paying the price. And the future gets closer every day. And I wish I could go back in time, maybe to live things differently, maybe to live them the same. I think about the past (my childhood especially) every day. And every single night I dream about the past too. The other day I had one about the last day of Year 11. I’ve had hundreds like it, all about the last day of secondary school. The thing that haunts me about it is the fact that I don’t remember what happened. All I remember is that I never saw any of my peers again after that day. Because I made the conscious decision to leave them, and go to a different college. Every single dream I have involves my old school friends. Every one.

In case it isn't clear, my recent doubts over starting (let alone completing, or succeeding with) my dissertation are related to so many other things that I have consciously, often deliberately bottled up over the years (and it is years). I know how unhealthy and dangerous it is to do this, but I do it anyway because it's easier, and because it's been the default way of accepting, contemplating and processing my emotions for as long as I can remember. I've never had the desire to tell anyone (including family) about my most vulnerable thoughts and feelings, fears and insecurities, because…well…where to start? Fear of judgement, fear of being misunderstood, fear of being understood, fear of the literal and emotional consequences on myself and on my relationships; the fact that emotions were and are are never discussed in my family, or in the few social circles I used to have (note: haven't had friends for five years). I bottle all of this up. And I'll continue to. But it feels like the bottle is starting to overflow.

If anyone has read this far, you might as well consider yourself the first person who has ever heard anything that is even remotely as private as what I've just revealed in these last few paragraphs. And if you've read this far — and if you are a healthy, ‘normal’ person — you will have obviously thought to yourself, “Yeah, he needs therapy”. But I don't think I do, and I certainly don't want to. There’s a small part of me that desires to let it all out (I could write a book about all of my problems), but I know that would be a terrifying and draining experience, even if it leads to something better. And the desire certainly isn't big enough for me to have serious thoughts about seeking help…from anyone in fact. I think that’s the bottom-line: regardless of whether I need help, or guidance, or advice, or support, or sympathy, I don't think I want it. Not enough, anyway. I think I’d hate myself for seeking it out because I'd feel like a desperately sad narcissist. I know I'm pathetic, dumb, probably annoying, an embarrassment, a failure, a waste of space, time, money and effort, but I don’t think I'm a narcissist. And I know that people who seek help aren't narcissistic, but I would think that I am if I did. So I don't. And I've never sought help from anyone. Not only the serious, personal stuff, but the little, trivial, specific things too. Is it because of a deep-rooted social anxiety, and my complete lack of social confidence, ability and experience? Yes. But like with my other anxieties that I probably ‘need’ help with — health anxiety, fear of the future, fear of the passage of time, the fear of failure, the fear of work, the fear of my dissertation — I don't care about help, or support, or self-improvement. I don’t want any of it because I think it won’t work for me, or that it doesn't apply to me. I don’t want to be helped. And yet here I am writing this.",2

"Hello,I am a 27 year old male, who recently had to end a 3 year relationship because things were not getting better. I put so much into it and thought we would marry. I noticed she would always watch asian stuff , really like asian boy bands, really liked asian boys and was not afraid to show it. I thought maybe its a fan girl thing but no. I saw her watching videos of girls that had asian boyfriends a lot and it was all asian boyfriend porn to put it into something understandable. She has out bursts a lot. She says things happened that really did not and it really scares me. I love her so much, but we can go on like this. I am not perfect either, I am a drug user, benzos are my weakness because I act terrible on them, I cut myself when I take them in large doses. its hard for me to control my dose because I use liquid, not pills, atm. I am going to court for a DUI theft and a VOP with 6 and a half years back up.... I am scared. I paid a lawyer 6000 for all the cases. I can play the piano real well people always tell me I am smart. I do not think I am very smart but people say it. I am sitting here, there is blood everywhere now.I cried and cut myself when I got home from the store and was a huge dick to my mom. we have a strange relationship. she has put me through a lot of hell by always trying to get me busted by the cops for drugs. I have been to jail for 7 months. I do not hate myself, I just feel so much pain because it seems nothing ever goes right for me. I love the girl so much and its hard to let go but I know she does not love me like she used to. we have sex less, the kisses are different. I do not know what to do. I am a good pianist, its the only thing I have a chance at. WHY DO I CUT MYSELF WHEN I TAKE BENZOS??????? I am so depressed, I cut myself really badly, this is not the first time",1

They adore me and I absolutely love them. Other than what happened my life is alright for the most part, could always be better but I cannot complain. I know a lot of people have it worse and I always try to stay positive. But this is just killing me, and when my wife or her family finds out about this is going to get really ugly. I often find myself thinking it will be really nice to just not wake up. I feel like that is a bit selfish but its just how I feel. My family would get a nice life insurance policy and it would settle the funds I lost. Again I know other people have it worse and I am sorry I feel bad for even coming her and venting like this.

"Firstly, apologies if this is really incoherent. I have never talked about this stuff so I am not quite sure how to. I am 20 years old and I got laid off from work about a month ago. At first I thought it would be a positive thing. I figured I would have time to pursue hobbies, be with friends and family, and enjoy some time off until I found another job. But instead, I have fallen into a deep depression. My friends have left me behind for various reasons, my mom and I are struggling to pay bills, and my car has broken down, so I have not even been able to leave the house. I have put in so many applications at so many different places and have not heard a single thing back. it is getting to the point where I am dissociating constantly and distancing myself from the few friends I still talk to. I do not even know why I am doing it, I genuinely do not want to, but every conversation leaves me feeling so drained and exhausted that it is just easier not to talk to anybody. My mom keeps up a smile and tells me we will get through it together, but I can tell it is weighing on her too. I feel so horrible and guilty that I am not helping with bills and I am trying everything I can to get back to a place where I am able to, but nothing is working.

I felt like I would have been judged if I would have told him that I was not feeling all there mentallyAnd one more incident here recently happened where me and a friend went to a bar and on our way over there I kind of get this familiar feeling of like loneliness and sadness and when we get into the bar and sit down they ask what we want to eat and drink and I was not in the mood for anything so I did not order anything I pretty much just stared off into space while we were there and after we left the bar we walked around the little shopping center area that it was in and then before we got back to my truck there was a park nearby with two Bridges that cross over a trail so I told my buddy that I was going to go take a piss and I would be right back I walk in between the two Bridges and sit down on the embankment or whatever the hell you call that thing and then I cried for about 5 to 10 minutes for absolutely no reason whatever And the background I would say the end of 2019 or beginning of 2020 I had made plans to go play pool with a coworker and right before I got to the pool hall they Called said that they could not go so I ended up going by myself and stayed there until about 2:00 a.m. playing pool by myself realizing that I was getting more and more lonely I decided to leave and drive to the park on the way there the feeling got stronger and when I got to the park I shut my truck off and cried for about a good 5 minutes at least and texted one of my co-workers that he was better at his job than I was at mineI honestly do not know if I am depressed or just lonely, because that feeling is not always constant, it is not always persistent 24/7 I think I might have depression",1

"21m before anyone says hydrate or exercise or hit showers please do not nothing gives me enjoyment. my dad left for 2 weeks and I have been alone the past days smoking all day because its the only thing that let us me not panic and become overwhelmed with how lonely i am. whenever i try to play games or watch tv i have 0 interest, porn or sleeping has completely no effect on me anymore. i sleep 11-13 hours a day as is, i cannot eat anything even though i have doordash money set aside, a house full of groceries, and tons of fruits and vegetables but everything sounds disgusting or i just have flat out no appetite. i have a car but my anxiety has made it impossible to go anywhere so I have been isolated in my apartment. its starting to get to a point where smoking weed feels like a chore, just to give myself enough comfort to cope with my loneliness. i reached out to a friend but since we have not spoke in a bit due to me not talking to anyone during this i do not know if he would want to hangout and i cannot exactly say hey I am depressed it would be really nice to have some human one on one time because you do not want to guilt them. had some difficult thoughts last night and i frequently talk aloud my very emotional thoughts at night. i feel like I am going crazy. i have a dr appt tomorrow for anti depressants but i do not know if I am strong enough to start this process alone but i do not know how long i can continue without it. this is tough and scary and I am kind of freaking out here. what do i do",1

I had a wonderful dream last night. I dreamed I was in love, and it was reciprocated. But it was not that that was important. It was the feeling that someone out with immediate family cared about me. Another random human being on this planet cared about me and what happens to me. I have never felt that before. It was undescribable. It was incredible. Then I woke up.

The pay was basic and I was able to pay bills.But I moved and was living off the stimulus checks when I lost the job I moved here for. I have got 2 part time jobs that will only be able to pay my housing, and a little more. But I would not able to afford the car.it is hard enough to leave the house to go to work when all I want to do is just lay in bed and let the world go on. I have no one that can help and my friend does not understand depression at all and tells me I need to just get over it and work more hours or find a better job. I do not live in a big city like they do. Opportunities do not overfloweth here.I have tried looking into ways of getting a different car but when your credit is bad, it is almost impossible.

She knows that the doctors said not to do that, but she didn't seem to care, which to me is more evidence that she doesn't care that much about my health. As I was gathering up my things to leave the room, I got more heated and called her a bitch for caring less about me than the inanimate objects we own. She got up and literally pushed me.

"Last week I posted about having to travel to Melbourne with my Sister who is a really nasty person, well it ended up being exactly what I feared, she was just plain nasty to me the entire 3 days. From the moment we arrived at out rented apartment, she would just do nothing but complain about me, saying that I'm so ""over dramatic"" and that ""I'm just anxious for attention"".......I mean really? I never wanted to be like this, and she has the way of making me feel like I'm a bad and worthless person. Now I will admit she has issues of her own, she has been pregnant so I can excuse her for that, but she has been like this for a few years now, I remember how I was anxious about my elbow swelling up and she said it was ""nothing"" and it turned out to be cellulitis. Ever since I came back from Melbourne, I've just been overthinking things, and when I do, it flares the anxiety right up.",3

"I wish i had friends. that is basically it. My high school life is incredibly boring, I have not had a healthy and proper friendship for a while now. I used to have a friend group but they kind of just left me behind I think, they still hangout together, nowadays when they see me in the hall we just say hi. the only time people actually talk to me is in class when they are asking about work, and even that rarely happens. in the normal school day, i only talk to one or two people, and those conversations do not even go past a minute. when i go home, i see people meet up with each other and plan out after school or weekends, and i kind of just wish i had that. I have been feeling like this since i started high school, but nothing has really changed. I feel like I am missing out on so much of my life because I have not been making good memories. Even outside of school i have trouble. I am going to this camping trip that my family and a bunch of other friends and family go to every year and i have been too scared or embarrassed to talk with the people my age. I kind of tried once, but it was difficult because i had nothing to really talk about, but everyone else there had no trouble getting along because they i think they hang out very frequently. everything i do nowadays is less interesting and i feel like I am being a disappointment to my parents because all i really do is school work. I do not go outside anymore to hangout with people, and I have lost motivation to go back to my sports and activities because to be honest, I cannot be bothered to deal with the bullshit and the awful and awkward feeling of trying to start conversations. Everything to me is boring now, even the video games i used to enjoy. I feel less motivated to do my school work (when school was in session) but i still do good in class because i have this feeling where if i get less than an A I am a disappointment because i basically do not do anything else beside school. every year my summer break is boring, except for the vacations. I spend everyday just essentially doing nothing. I am on the computer half of the time and i get bored. I watch tv and I am bored. I go outside and go on walks and to the mall and I am bored, and that usually makes me feel worse because i see everyone else hanging out. I do not think anyone has gotten the sense that i feel this way because i usually just act happy in school and around my parents. I still tell them that i hang out with people in school but not outside but tbh that is not really true. I wish Id stay and actually learn a sport or something like basketball once most people who play sports are pretty sociable and have friends. I dunno. I have not told anyone this because they might think I am complaining. I have a very good life and I am thankful that my parents are there to provide for me, but something just feels lacking, not on their part but on mine. I pretty much have nothing to do nowadays and i wish i did. Sorry if this seems cluttered, I am just venting this out finally. I do not know how to explain it, but i feel empty and useless most of the time. Why cannot i make friends",1

"I have hit another low point in life again and i now have to start taking my antidepressants again after I quit since Jan this year. I forgot how the side effects always kick in hardest when you first start it. I have not slept for the past 2 days at all, feeling hungry and restless and I am so fucking tired. I am a student too, and it makes it so hard for me to focus on work (both at home and in school)I just wished I did not let myself get to this state again. I wish that I could have realised earlier that I had only been coping with my issues, not healing from them :/ restarting on antidepressants again and it sucks",1
"So here is how I am going. I have been doing terrribly mentally, I do not have a job a currently, I am 26 years old. trying to find one.

I play a game of smite and I feel like I am about to have a mental breakdown even if I win. I am miserable constantly I do not want to stay in bed all day because I want a job. but I have been doing customer service since i was 18. and saying I am sick of it is an understatement I would rather die at this point then talk to another customer about coupons. I am severely overweight, have health issues and am ugly. I have the lowest self esteem possible, I hate everything about myself. all I think about is dying every day. I cannot handle any sort of bad news anymore. I am not sure what is entirely wrong with me. but this mental prison I have myself in is a type of hell. I need to find a way out or I am not going to last alot longer. to go into why i feel like this would be mostly about my past and I will not go into that. very long story, but not having a job to help support myself and having my friends help while I do not have one stresses me out to the point to where I am not sleeping more than maybe 3 hours a day, I am exhausted all the time. I just do not know what to do anymore. how do i ask for help when i do not even know what is wrong? My mental health is deteriorating",1
"Coping Idk if this will be helpful to anyone else but I've been a hypochondriac my whole life, since very young. Over the last year I decided to improve my anxiety problems. I had an experience recently that kind of personified how I went about learning to cope better. Basically, when I was in high school, smoking weed usually gave me panic attacks until after it actually set in. After i took a hit, I had a hard time accepting the reality of the situation, which is the key point I am making here. As I have improved with my anxiety issues over the past year, I took up smoking weed again for a while, with very little anxiety. A couple weeks ago, I smoked more than I usually did, so the set in was much more intense. Although it felt good, I noticed there was some anxiety building up in the back of my mind. I began to panic. But I decided to try just letting go, and accepting the reality of what was happening. No more anxiety, I was able to enjoy the drug. So basically, what worked for me was accepting that something bad may happen to me and I just have to accept that and deal with it.",2

"I’m Afraid My Mom Might Hurt Me So the preface, I’m someone in my early twenties living with my parents. My parents have been fighting for years, occasionally physically. This would usually include my mom knocking in my dad’s door to argue with him. These arguments would usually start with topics that included bills, taxes, or myself, that would eventually escalate to more personal matters I will not get into too much here. I used to try to intervene when things got too heated since they can’t stop themselves, but recently I have decided not to so anymore as the last time I tried to intervene, my mom did physically attack  me (I didn’t get hurt, I was just standing in front of my dad and she lurched at me).

Last night, she called me to ask if I could knock on my dad’s door, since he wasn’t responding to her calls, because she “needed to pay a bill.” I knew that this wasn’t just about a bill, so I compromised and sent him a text instead, I even sent her a screenshot as proof. And I wasn’t going to call him/wake him up in the middle of the night unless it was an emergency, as I would consider it to be rude to do so. 

She then says “don’t worry your little head about, go back to sleep or whatever, okay?” 

Then, she called me again, this time saying “What are the consequences gonna be? Knock on the fucking door.” I declined, saying I don’t want to be a part of whatever was going on between them, and she should talk to him about this, to which she said “I know. He’s your loving dad, and I’m the evil mom.” 

I said goodnight to her, she laughs and responded with “not goodnight. Good bye.” 

I say that I will talk to her tomorrow, and she replies “I’ll never talk to you again. Not tomorrow, not the next day, or the next.”

She then calls me twice then immediately hangs up. 

She calls me one more time that night, here are the things she said when I declined to knock on my dads door again:

“I ask you to do one simple thing, and you didn’t do it. It’s just a simple thing! I tried calling your dad, and he isn’t answering me. It’s not like you’re picking sides or anything! Translation: “Look at what I do for you! And yet, you can’t this simple task for me? Well then I will rescind my love for you!”

“It’s not like you’re picking sides or anything!”

“You’re full of shit, just like him (my dad).”

“Where has your dad been all of your life?”

“You need to take responsibility.”

“Is this what one of your councilors told you to say, the one that I pay [x amount of money, I don’t exactly remember].”

“You don’t even know what is going on.”

“But fine. You can do whatever- go to sleep, wake up in the morning, do whatever you do.”

Me: “ok. Goodnight, mom.”

And finally, I said goodnight to her, and she said: “Don’t call me mom. Just say good night.”

That’s not to say my dads innocent either or anything - he’s hella toxic and has treated my mom poorly as well, so it is hard to tell where the abuse and victimization starts and ends between the two of them. Basically, they’re both each others abusers and victims, if that makes any sense at all. 

But I do believe he is the safer parent, as although he can, at his worst, make me feel very uncomfortable to be around him, as he is kind of an asshole at times, I don’t feel like my safety is threatened around him, unlike with my mom. He’s a lesser of two evils , if you will.

So I just feel really anxious right now. I did not want to be used as a pawn against dad, and my mom immediately associated me with him. So, now I’m afraid that when she comes home, she will start to treat exactly like she treats dad, or worse. I’m afraid she might start pounding my door and attacking verbally and physically. 

Okay that is all, I just needed to vent. Thank you for reading this.",2

"I find it so frustrating as a highly anxious and depressed person to do career tests because they rely on your passion for specific activities and I find myself answering ""I dislike it very much"" to the various questions (e.g,. working in construction, healthcare, finance, whatever). I've been trying to get back to work again because it seems my severe depression and anxiety won't go away and there is only so much medication and therapy can help me. Of course, I haven't tried every kind of therapy but what had been offered to me at low cost. But I've tried many medications.

Anyhow, I feel very frustrated because after trying couple of online part time jobs (like writing marketing stuff on websites) and finding myself not motivated enough to work sufficient hours to make ends meet, I'm trying to start from zero again and do some career tests to find what motivates me. But those tests don't offer some magical information but just rely on what you're passionate about. Like they give you 50 questions and ask you how much you like doing different activities, like installing cabinets, diagnosing disease in people, giving financial advice to someone wanting to get a loan, helping a disabled person get dressed, playing a musical instrument in front of an audience, taking care of sick animals, etc etc etc.

I hate them ALL! None of these activities excite me. Because having a job is always about what others expect of you. But mental illness sucks so much of your energy that there is so little left for the job.

Like if I'm a cashier, my high anxiety and depression and the various thoughts and emotions and physical symptoms I experience will take so much of my energy to control and nothing left to put on a smile and make a customer feel welcome and at the same time do my job of scanning items very quickly and correctly.

That's why I've been trying to find jobs that are just online and things I can do on my own time, so that whenever the damned mental health issues give me a break then I can do the job. The problem is there are too many people doing these jobs and they pay so little that I've had to start looking at other options. 

Damn it, I don't know what I want to hear from you, to be honest, I mean I already am so filled with self-hatred and hatred for the world, I am working myself into anger just writing about it.",1

"Currently going through a rough patch again. Had half of a ""falling out"" situation with my parents recently. Relationship with my (bipolar) girlfriend is on a mutually imposed hiatus because she wants to be alone a lot lately having started a new job after being out of work for over a year and a half needing to adjust I guess and me being someone that enjoys and needs affection. And two days ago my car broke down. Just came home from my work summer event (professional life is going great actually but atm I feel like I am just functioning). Came home and immediately grabbed my guitar and started playing and singing my soul out to the song ""Dead Flowers"" by the Rolling Stones (playing the Townes Van Zandt version). And then it happened. A genuine flashback. 4 years ago I was on a kind of soul searching trip in Vietnam. Sitting on a Rooftop in Hanoi I played guitar and sang by myself and this girl was watching me and after a brief moment of silence she looked me dead in the eye and said ""You sing when you are sad, do not you?"" And it hit me like a truck. I do not know why I am even posting this on here. I guess I juest need to vent. I really really hope that our hiatus will work out. I still do not know how I will get through the next 4 weeks but I will manage somehow because she is worth it to me... we have been really good friends on a deep level for years and our relationship just started in February of this year. At the start of this year everything was going so well. I was out of therapy and started a new career path in IT and then ""we"" happened. And now it feels like everything is falling apart. I just hope I will have the strength to carry on. Because at the moment that is the only thing left for me to do. Again I do not know why I am posting this here. I guess some words of encouragement would be nice. I do not know... I hope you are all having a better night than I am. The question that felt like a shot straight through the heart.",1

"I am 19, and after a shitty first year of college because of online school, i just completely feel like, well, shit. This year in general just made me feel like shit. When i entered college, i was sure i wanted to be a therapist, though ironically, due to my mental issues and poor talking abilities, that does not sound too appealing anymore. The only other thing I am super passionate about is art and animation, but I am scared to go into it because I am afraid it could kill my passion.I just feel so lost. I do not know what i really want to do, and college and my parents do not exactly help ease the stress. After reaching out to a therapist, i started wondering what i wanted to do in life. Not in a career sense, but a personal one. To be honest, all i ever wanted to do in life was to just be myself. While i would not say I have had to put on completely different personas before, I have always felt like i always had to hide a bit of myself from people, whether friends, family, etc. The only times I have ever felt like i could be myself are when I am alone, and even then, that is slightly ruined, because I have somehow internalized my anxiety so much, that ill be scared and think "" what if someone finds out"" even though I am literally the only one in my room.In reality, i just want to express myself. I want to be outgoing and learn about art, music, acting etc. I want to nerd out about whatever topic I am really into at a point. I want to be more sarcastic than quiet. At the same time, i want to be able to tell people how much i value my solitude time. I want to just be able to be by myself a lot of the time. I just do not want to have to hide myself from the world.Sorry that this was really rambly, but it was a thing I have been thinking about for a while. The only thing i really want in life is to just be myself",1

"Sad girl hour\*I have came to the conclusion that I have never loved myself... Like... Ever ? You hear of people saying ""self love, self acceptance"" ""practicing self love"" and I have looked at ""ways"" of how these folks have achieved such a thing and I have tried you know? Positive self talk, bring grateful, taking time to yourself etc.. and I am just baffled like am I missing something ? maybe I do not commit myself fully to it, but it all seems a bit... Surface level ? Idk man. I just do not really like myself, I am super self aware like I know I am insecure,awkward and I know WHY I am insecure, I know I can be jealous and I know WHY I can be jealous, I have digged deep into my childhood/teenagehood and I know it is stemmed from there, I was bullied and put down a lot and then continuously into bad relationships, just grasping and searching for someone to love me to make up for not loving myself just rendering myself in a worse state than before the relationship... On the flip side I know I am loving to others, I am kind and I stand up for what is right, I have been able to become more confrontational as I have gotten older, I used to be that person who would get beat down and not utter a word back in self defence, so I guess that is a plus ?...But I do not think I am attractive, I hate that I feel flawed and jealous and insecure, I hate that the hobbies I once thrived on are just clutter in my cupboard and drawers now :'( I hate that I cannot sleep at night but waste most of my days away asleep, then when I am awake I am autopilot, just the basics to keep my house going and myself alive. it is bleak. I find hardly any pleasure in life, I hate the city I live in, I do not get to be in nature (or allow myself to be outside because being outside especially alone is so daunting, I \*need\* someone with me)much and when I am those are the few times I feel at peace, and sadly I am in no position to move to a place like that... I do not have any friends, because mentioned before I was bullied a lot as a kid/teen so it made me feel inadequate, my social skills suck balls I do not know how to keep friends, I have been able to speak to people in workplaces (I have not worked since the start of lockdown last year) and keep friendly relationships there but I have not been able to carry that on outside of it, even when it is been offered to me, I just feel like... I do not want to bother people with my inconsistency or just myself in general. Ugh, my dudes. This went a bit further than I thought, this was supposed to be just about not being able to wrap my head around how folk are able to make self love work for them because it does not click mentally for me lol. Self love ? Tf even is that ?",1

"The worst things about hypochondria Hypochondria is the worst thing to ever happen to me, everyday I’m crippled by it. I guess I just wanted to make a list of all the worst things I go through as a hypochondriac.

1. Seeing healthy people and wishing you were like them (even though you probably are healthy but your brain is telling you you’re not)
2. Changing daily routines based off the health issue you think you have at the time
3. Changing your entire diet to become healthier (for me it has been limiting carbs and sugars because I’m afraid of developing diabetes)
4. Checking your pulse all the time to make sure your heart is beating properly (unfortunately for me my heart is never beating normally, I have constant heart palpitations and my heart races a lot, not even sure if it’s due to anxiety. I’m scared it’s something serious)
5. Having very bad mental health days where you can’t leave your house (this happens to me a lot)
6. Not knowing if your symptoms are caused by anxiety or something serious (this drives me absolutely insane)
7. Not being able to lead a normal productive (for me I can’t hold a job, because I always fear something bad will happen to me at work and I’ll panic)
8. Being triggered by seeing things on shows or in movies. For instance, a man has a heart attack in the show your watching and then you freak out about having a heart attack
9. Obsessively looking up symptoms and not being able to stop once you start
10. Wasting a ton of money on doctors appointments only for them to say you’re okay
11. Being in tons of debt from going to the ER because you think you’re dying
12. Always looking for reassurance from others, obsessively asking others if they ever have the same symptoms as you so you don’t feel alone

These are the only ones I can think of right now, but feel free to list the things you deal with as a hypochondriac I’m curious about what others go through.",2
so i already posted something about this before but it wa more of a vent this is more of a flailing desperate attempt to figure out what to do i have a jury summons tomorrow morning i m crossing my finger that somehow despite it being the weekend they might still update my status a ended so i don t have to go but i know my chance are slim to none i know myself well even if i manage to get any sleep at all tomorrow morning will be hell on earth my anxiety is gon na have a field day it s already pregaming right now given that info i wa wondering if any of you have called in sick to your jury summons because of anxiety and how that went i m willing to try going but should i find that my anxiety is just too much i d like to have some sort of a plan b it kind of scare me the idea of calling in cause idk if they d consider sickness caused by anxiety a good enough reason besides that i know some place will just have you reschedule while others might not be so easy going all this legal stuff freak me out i don t want to be held in contempt sent to jail or fined but i also would rather not have to have a mental break down in front of a bunch of people i don t really have any medication that can help other than propranolol but all that doe is slow my heart rate the last time i took it to try and help during a stressful event i still felt short of breath and really nauseous which wa honestly kind of new i ended up having to hide away from people for like an hour till i felt somewhat better even then after another hour or so i started feeling really anxious again idk what to do i know jury summons isn t really that bad most normal people just think it s boring but for me having so much wait time will just lead to me obsessing over how i m feeling i can t really distract myself that well because i ll constantly be anticipating being called up which could be within the first hour could be multiple hour or possibly not at all on top of that it s early in the morning which i have a pretty bad track record with too early morning like that usually result in me feeling nauseous which result in me not being able to eat much you can t eat in the assembly room but you can t really leave in case they have an announcement so i d have to wait if i wait too long i start to feel really shaky and weak i d say hypoglycemic but i ve been tested for that and apparently i don t have it maybe i m just in starvation mode all the time so i run out of energy nutrient fast anyways any advice is welcome,1

"I am 25 years old. I have struggled with social anxiety, depression, disordered eating and gender dysphoria since I was 13. Twelve years of suffering. This past year-and-a-half the pandemic came along, of course, and destroyed any improvements I might have made prior to it (even if some of those were admittedly a bit of a facade, me convincing myself and others I would improved because ""I am doing this good thing now and I am not doing that bad thing anymore""). The pandemic has affected everyone in different ways; I feel like it is effects for me have been multiple and some of then I am feeling far more now (at the ""end"" of lockdown) than I ever did during the height of lockdown.there is the enforced isolation, which has increased my social anxiety tenfold, to the point where the loosening of restrictions only means I am isolating even more because there is too many people outside and I cannot cope with them seeing me, looking at me, interacting with me, forming an opinion of me - even a split-second, meaningless judgement is terrifying. I know it is irrational, but social anxiety has this way of making the irrational fears so loud and intrusive that they can become self-fulfilling. I can rationally say to myself, ""nobody cares, nobody's looking at you"". Then I take a 5 minute walk to the shop and have a panic attack due to being so overwhelmed with anxiety. Well now everyone is looking at you, because you are staggering around hyperventilating clutching your chest like you are having a heart attack, you dumb shit. Then there is all the time spent alone with my own thoughts, ruminating over every little thing I have ever said and done, punishing myself and berating myself for things I said without thinking back in ""normal"" times when face-to-face social interaction was a daily occurrence so I let my guard and filter down. I do not just mean cringey moments (although I have plenty of those too), but cruel or thoughtless comments and actions which honestly just make me a terrible human being. Then there is the doomscrolling. Literally, on news websites etc. but also figuratively, in my own mind, which was arguably the master of spiralling into negative and pessimistic thoughts about the world long before ""doomscrolling"" was even a term. Thinking about how we got here and where we are headed and how fucked up the world is. Overpopulation and overconsumption and human selfishness and speciesism mean future pandemics and local and global travesties are only going to get more common. This is not the ""end"", it is just the beginning. Climate change is always on my mind, to some degree. I feel helpless and hopeless, I do not believe humanity will change enough or in time to save this planet. I do the things I can, but I am painfully aware I could be doing more and be more of an activist if I was less depressed and self-pitying. I am also painfully aware that I could do everything in my power and it would not scratch the surface, so long as huge money-obsessed corporations continue to because more destruction in a day than I could in a year, even if I did not bother to try at all. My gender dysphoria is worse because I was forced to sit with my thoughts and acknowledge it for what it really is and always has been. Denial is not healthy, but it sure feels better sometimes than admitting an uncomfortable truth to yourself. And once you admit that truth? You have to fight tooth and nail to get the things required to finally feel comfortable in your own damn skin. I am lucky that coming out was relatively safe and painless for me in terms of others' reactions, and I am so grateful for that. But boy is it a lot of work having to repeatedly ""prove"" your identity to strangers, while constantly second-guessing it yourself (hello, imposter syndrome), only to be told everything is a 3 year wait and costs thousands. Fill out this form and take this test and pay for this consultation and even then you are not our ideal candidate, so we will get back to you. it is exhausting and I have so little fight left in me. Giving up means giving up any possibility that I will ever be happy but sometimes I still want to, just because I am tired of it. That last sentence was about my gender dysphoria, sure, but it is also how I feel about life as a whole. Suicide is giving up. A dead person cannot be happy, but they cannot be miserable either. I am also in physical pain that I cannot get looked at by a medical professional because the doctors need photo ID to update my name, which I do not have. My back and knees are a steady 3/10 when busy or distracted. 7/10 when I try to sleep, unless I am blackout drunk. 9/10 if I smoke weed, for some reason. Everyone talks about weed helping with pain, but if I smoke I am damn near calling myself an ambulance just to get high-strength painkillers because my back hurts so much. I feel fairly sure the physical pain is related to a sedentary lifestyle. I sit at work all day, then I sit and watch TV or go to bed early, I do not exercise because I am scared to go outside and besides I have no motivation. It cannot be good for me and I think my body is trying to tell me that. Every time I try to end a post like this I think of something else, another reason I feel so suicidal. Maybe I should focus on the positives? I am young, maybe not in tip-top physical condition but probably fixable to a decent standard of health/comfort with the right treatment and effort. I live in a wealthy country with access to everything I could ever need. I have a job, I am financially independent, I can make rent and pay for food and even luxuries. I have a family who love me (especially my mum, who means everything to me). I could probably be fairly attractive if I worked out and took better care of myself. I am not unintelligent and I have some compassion, so I could probably do things to help people and better the world if I put more effort in. All of these positives just fill me with so much guilt. I do not deserve these benefits or opportunities, they are wasted on me. Focusing on the positives makes me wish someone else could take my place and be in my position and make full use of it, so I could just be dead. I just want to kill myself. I just want to kill myself",1

"It doesn't help me.   I HATE when I say things like ""Killing myself is easier than going to college to get a job that I will hate later"" people keep saying ""there's people in the hospital that would give everything to be in your place"", like, bro, I know that and you're just making things worse by making me think that I must be happy all the times because I not in the hospital, but I'll die someday and I want that soon, because then at least I'll be remebered by some people that will be still alive.
  And also I hate that everything that I do it seeem like I'm the worst at it, even if it's just me and one other person, they will always be beter than me, and I was talking about that with one of my techers and she said ""then what do you like?"", nothing, literally everything that I do is because my mom wants me to do it and I'm too afraid of making her sad/angry by saying that I don't like it.

"I have gone through multiple periods of major depression that sometimes lasted years. I have tried countless medications while seeing many psychiatrists and psychologists. I am dyslexic, and I was physically and emotionally abused as a child. I come out of it by just trying to improve my situation as much as I can no matter how hopeless it seems because its the only good strategy. No matter how hopeless it seems, it can all turn around in six months. Random bad things will adversely affect us, but so will random good things. Do what you can with diet, exercise, meditation, prayer (if that works for you). You can come out of your depression.",1

"I kind of like it? I guess a little backstory for me: I (18) was diagnosed with depression (and ADHD if that’s at all relevant) a year or two back and have been medicated on and off since…

but no matter if i’m medicated or not I can’t help but WANT to sleep all the time. Like I’m not always that tired, but sometimes i’ll get a very slight wave of drowsiness and take that as an opportunity to just cozy up in my bed and lay down. I don’t go on my phone laying in my bed. I just lay there. sometimes I’ll lay there with my eyes closed for a few minutes.. on and off I’ll suddenly feel a little more awake but be too comfortable to want to get up, or feel so slightly tired that I wanna just lay down and ‘fix it’

But I kind of like it? Like I know that if I tell people I want to sleep all day they’ll often just say it’s depression and that I ‘don’t want to exist’ or something like that.. I want to exist.. I just only ever feel so slightly motivated for 2-3hr at a time. and I live with my mother so i don’t have much real reason to get out and do anything because she seems completely fine with supporting me (which I still often feel bad about still depending on her). And small triumphs like doing my laundry or cleaning my room can’t be it. I’m supposed to be an adult. I’m supposed to have a job. I’m supposed to have any kind of relationship with people. I don’t even have my license. 

I don’t even know what to call this.. asking for advice? rant? doubting my own depression? either way I think I liked examining how i’m feeling a little bit",1
"I do not truly know my own sexuality. Whenever I am in a relationship, it always feels wrong.

I have been diagnosed with depression and mild autism, and I have heard that is a common thread, but it feels like it is just me. I do not even know if it is worth living a life where I am deluding myself that I will find someone. I tell everyone in this sub that they will find someone, because that is what I tell myself. I do not even know if that is true anymore. Forever alone",1
"Basically I’m going through quite a bit right now. I suffer from anxiety, depression probably (low mood, irritation, poor concentration) and things just haven’t been going that well.

"HA for two weeks - just discovered what its like Hi all;

So the last two weeks have been a ride for me. I've always had a buildup of wax in my left ear (runs in the family). A few weeks ago I noticed a ringing noise in my left ear. I went to the doctor and they said it was an ear infection. So I started taking antibios ... didnt go away. So today I went to an ENT, who suctioned out my ears and gave me stronger antibiotics and reaffirmed me that this is most definitely a temporary phenomenon and will go away in time (1 week, 1 hour, 1 month ... he said ears take awhile to heal). I had this confirmed by many of my friends that experienced ear infections as well. The ringing will go away, just in time.

The problem is... throughout the past several days, I spent the majority of my time convincing myself that I had some sort of major illness. The first concern was cancer, then that turned into a meningiti, then that turned into inner ear concerns, then that turned into HIV concerns ...

I don't know how I arrived at any of these conclusions. I had no symptoms of any of these illnesses, yet I immediately assumed that I had them. No way do I have meningitis, I would know by now ... no way do I have cancer, it doesnt really run in my family nor do I display any other symptoms. No way do I have aids ... I have not exposed myself in any way that would put me into a situation where it was possible. 

My friends and peers are all convinced I have anxiety issues and need to see a counselor. I went to one last week and she pretty much confirmed that I have anxiety issues that are beginning to manifest themselves in a moderate form of hypochondria. I literally started checking myself every day for things .... lumps, rashes, bruises .... 

I write because I'm curious to know other people's stories. How do you cope with this? This constant anxiety-driven fear of having a major disease. I've spent so much time over my break from school researching illnesses, conditions, symptoms ... trying to connect the dots from anything I could have possibly been exposed to in the past. The slightest itch would terrify me. An ingrown hair on my belt-line convinced me I had an STD. 

In effect, I didn't actually live the past week. My worrying sapped away from my actual living. 

Sorry for the long drawn out rant. ",2

Like I feel more or less fine, just I feel at the same time, how am I worth ANYTHING?I even got prescribed an antidepressant lately that I do not even want to take and have not been taking, a large part of me does not think I want to feel better.I have no plan, nor am I going to take any action to kill myself, but this is just how I have been feeling.

"I have always had depression, but over the last few years, I have worked really hard to deal with it. I quit drinking, moved to a new city, made a ton of great new friends, and worked a bunch of part-time jobs that I really loved while pursuing full-time work in my industry. I was always going to concerts, plays, and other fun events. While there were always things that could be better, I kept as busy as I could so that I would not dwell on the negative aspects of life.Then COVID happened and the world shut down. I stopped getting work at most of my jobs, while other jobs went online-only (which I hate). I could barely see my friends for a year and a half. I have not seen my family since December 2019 because they live in another province and travel is restricted.All I have had is alone time. And boy, is it lonely. I have never felt more single in my life. When you strip life down to the bare essentials, you realize how alone you really are. it is not to say I do not have friends or people who care for me, but it is just not the same as having a partner to support you. The idea that these lockdowns and restrictions could go on forever in some capacities is so fucking depressing. I will be alone forever. The pandemic stole my life from me.",1

"My new job makes me want to be dead A couple weeks ago, I started a new job.

I'm a 30yo male web dev, with only just over a year of working experience.

My previous job was working for a guy building some side projects (mostly web3 based stuff), but we didn't run with any of them.

Well, a few weeks ago he told myself and the 1 other dev he hired that he needs to focus on his primary business, since that's keeping him too busy to really get stuck into anything with us.

It's understandable and he was even awesome enough to hook us both up with jobs at a another startup.

At first I was pretty excited, since this startup is also web3 based and most of my knowledge and skills involve blockchain tech.

Well, as it turns out they're primarily making use of the MEAN stack (more specifically Ionic) and up until a few weeks ago, I had 0 experience with that stack.

My experience is primarily writing smart contracts with Solidity and I would say I'm probably even above average, when it comes to it.

I also have a little experience when it comes to React/Next and Nest.js

Unfortunately for me, even though they're a web3 company, they don't need much in the way of smart contracts, and what they do need is a full stack MEAN dev...

I've felt like a fish out of water recently, but I've been trying my best.

For the past, nearly a month, I've been spending 70+ hours a week working and studying.

I'm pretty much either learning the tech, working, going to the gym here and there or sleeping.

I still feel like I haven't learned enough fast enough though and I'm pretty sure I'm going to lose this job...

If I do, I don't know what I'm going to do and that scares me and seriously gets me down.

I've seriously even thought about ending it all, if I lose this job.

Anyway, just wanted to get that off my chest and if anyone has any advice or guidance, I'm open to anything.

Thanks.",1

"I find myself between a hard place and a rock, I am a 30M and my wife is 26F. We have a blended family and that on its own is sometimes a challenge with all the different schedules. I am reaching out because I am finding it hard to manage my time with all 4 kids, supporting my wife, work and home responsibilities and upkeep. I work from home so that has definitely made things a bit easier, during work hours I use my work breaks and lunch times to tend to the kids or check in on my wife. My wife also works from home but with her depression being as bad as it is she struggles a lot to help me with the kids or the upkeep of the house. I know that I am strong enough to push through this tough time in life but I just want to see what others may have done in my position. Sometimes it feels like I am raising 4 kids on my own. Its been over a year now and I find myself questioning if I am doing enough for the kids since I can feel there is a disconnect. How do I tell my wife I need quality time and space with the kids without sending her down a hole of emotions, anxiety &amp; overthinking? How do I tell our kids that their mom is depressed so they understand? How do I manage my time with these struggles? How do I care for my depressed wife but still make time for our kids?",1

"Hantavirus Hi all. I have OCD, hypochondria, panic disorder, Cyclothymia, blah blah blah, the whole nine yards. Health anxiety fucks me up like daily, but this week it's been super bad. 

So my fiance and I found a mouse in our room and kept it in a box for a bit because we had just had a bad snowstorm and don't want to put it out there and have it freeze. We've been packing because we're about to move and so we've been kicking stuff up, but haven't found any droppings. Of course after we caught the mouse there were droppings in the box. 
Anyway, now about a week and a half later, I have heavy chest pressure, a dry cough, and back pain in the area of pleurisy. I went to medemerge last night and my blood pressure was 98/65, pretty low, but the doctor kept saying how great it was. I was diagnosed with a upper respiratory infection, but she also gave me an antibiotic because my tonsils were pretty big. 

Well this morning I wake up and as I'm brushing my teeth I hack up something black. What the hell?!? I'm freaking out! 

I live in NJ but don't know the Hantavirus facts about NJ.",2
"I know the best thing for me is to find a new job, but I've been applying for quite awhile now with no luck and I really don't want to move to another job that I don't enjoy and will make me feel the exact same way. I sort of think I have an idea of what I want to do, but I have no idea how to make it happen while still paying my bills so I've been applying to anything that seems like it might be relevant to me, but I'm not sure the right way to go about getting into a field I don't have a degree in. Because of this I feel trapped in my job right now and it gets so bad some days where I feel like just walking out and quitting or just not going in ever again. I'm rambling at this point, does anyone else deal with a job that makes them completely miserable? How do you deal with it?",3

It’s gotten to the point where it’s affecting my overall health. I feel fatigued, depressed, and anxious… much, much more than usual.

yesterday evening i had the worst panic attack of my entire life this ended up making me feel drained defeated and like i wa an absolute freak for the rest of the day i ended up venting on a subreddit about how i felt and a lot of the comment actually helped me a lot and one reminded me of a couple of old trick that a therapist taught me awhile ago that i wished i would ve remembered yesterday when your brain is feeling really overloaded and so busy that you almost seem manic and don t even know where to begin to start the best thing you can do is force yourself to sit down and allow your body to sink into the chair while you close your eye and just sit there in silence for a moment this allows you to relax your body long enough to feel the emotion that is bothering you the most however if you find more than one specific emotion coming to mind you are still too overwhelmed and need to sit for awhile longer once i can identify what i am feeling the most i just say one word out loud sad scared tired angry etc and reflect why i might be feeling that way and what i am able to do on that very moment to make myself feel better taking a shower napping asking someone for a hug etc it s important to focus on the thing that you feel like you can start to work on in that moment because if you allow your brain to slip back to thing out of your control you will end back up at square one he also reminded me that these are all normal emotion and that i am not weird or crazy for feeling the way that i am and that it is ok to ask for help or set up boundary for myself i used to use this one more during busy quarter in college but can still be really helpful for trying to squish anxiety down before having to do something you can t get out of which could be taking a test going for an interview or even making a phone call i like to picture all of my anxiety and worry a little people boarding a boat on a river and just like to imagine them floating away and out of my view even if it is just for the time needed to complete that one task that i have to do i really hope these help someone because these trick used to help me a ton when i wa going through some rough patch in life and i think i m going to start using them again,1

"Actually you're a total badass Most people are mentally and emotionally sane, relatively at least. They might claim that the worry is all in your head, not understanding that your corporeal experience strongly suggests otherwise. They might tell you to think positive, because they don't have an inner voice that constantly gets drowned out by a huge stadium packed with negative objectors. They might take it rather personally when socializing is the very least thing you want to do, they could never imagine that them yapping on about their normal life drains your already depleted life-energy. Some of them might start all kinds of shit with you because they see you as a weak and opportune victim to unload their own shit towards, never realizing they're the real cowards.

Some of them might truly want to help you out and tell you get therapy asap, then you might see some random bureaucrat person completely devoid of empathy struggling to stay awake while you pour you heart of desperately looking for some kind of assistance. Assistance that usually comes in form of dubious drugs that only work at a hefty price by the way So they advice you to go see some private expensive experts, unaware of the fact that your wallets suffers with you. They like to imply that you just chill the f out and relax. Because they don't have that intrusive, horrible, horrible, horrible, encompassing, joy-devouring, soul-obliterating, sucking, painful, torturous, uneasy pit of dread stuck right in their stomach with racing thoughts to boot. Perhaps they'll make sly remarks on how you need to just grow up, after all, they don't know how's it's like to think like an adult while emotionally reacting like a little fragile child scared to death.

They might say go the gym or be physically active and get some endorphins running. To be fair, is actually solid advice if you can muster the strength to go there. Off course they have their problems too, the difference however is that your problem is you and how that you contaminate every aspect of your life. The point is, according to some of 'them' you're just a loser, useless, lazy, afraid, a waste of space, a failure with nothing to show for in life. They are so much better than you and intentionally or not they make you buy their version of you.

However. It's just opinions from judgemental people at the end of the day. I don't want to you to waste any energy on harboring any resentment, envy or anger towards anybody, they just don't understand. How could they know the truth. Perhaps even you don't the truth about yourself, so I'm going to say it, just in case.

You simply being here and keeping on makes you a tough as nails. A warrior that fights hordes of demons every day. Bravery is defined by the will to face fear, you have fear stuffed in your face all the time. You may suffer endless anxiety, but you as a matter of fact are courageous by the definition of the word. Doing your best to just keep going, that's it. It's not some lofty motivational speech, just a cold fact.

It may not help you any bit to read this, but I for one will not let it be unsaid. Anxiety is bad enough in itself, so rather than feeling shame in addition you have earned the right to have pride in yourself. My intention is for you to keep that in mind on your darkest days, because I know very well what it's like to suffer anxiety while having your character measured by factors out of your control.",2

"I have struggled with anxiety depression my whole life. I have extreme anxiety which I think ultimately makes me depressed. I put off dealing with the issues for years, because of stigma and just not understanding what was going on. In my late teens my mom finally forced me start medicine and see a therapist. I had a lot of bad circumstances, but after I graduated college my life suddenly started looking up. A few months after graduating the most amazing thing happened. I met this cute, funny, guy through mutual friends - and he asked me out on a date. There was an instant attraction. We talked everyday and began dating officially a month later. It was the happiest Id ever been in my life. I had a job, I moved out of my parents house, I had friends, and I had a loving boyfriend. My life was finally coming together how I wanted it. I thought, maybe my depression and anxiety are finally gone. I was always anxious about something bad happening because my life seemed too good to be true.Then - just a few weeks after we celebrated our 6 month anniversary, my boyfriend came over to my house one day and dumped me. I was completely blindsided. He told me he just was not as invested in the relationship as he should be, and was not falling in love with me. He cut me off and never reached out, even on my birthday. My life fell apart. All of my anxiety and depression came back in full swing.I realized that I am not valued or competent at my job, all of my friends have boyfriends who they would much prefer to hang out with. And honestly? I miss living with my parents and can barely afford to make it by. I hate my life. Everyday I go to sleep and hope that I just do not wake up. I want to disappear. I frequently fantasize about suicide but I know I am not brave enough to do it. I have put my poor parents through enough by creating such a mess of my life. Nothing can make it better, just have to keep dealing with the pain of life. I think this is rock bottom",1

"Honestly, which antidepressant withdrawal is not poop? I go to every sub in Bupropion, Escitalopram, Paroxetine, Effexor, Sertraline, Duloxetine, Mirtazapine, Amitriptyline, Fluoxetine, and I can list more, but every sub says ""this med has the worst withdrawal"".

Yeah, withdrawals and discontinuation syndromes suck. But discouraging people from taking medication X that his doc prescribed now he's scared to take it is immoral.

You had this experience, fine, doesn't mean he will. I saw a post on someone taking clonazepam for years on 6 mgs a day.

He stupidly cold-turkey'd one day and even months later he had no withdrawals. Other's might have lethal seizures.

It's very annoying to see a question about medication X and then tons of comments practically tell him not to take it because of withdrawals. 

Withdrawals are normal, so are discontinuation syndromes. You must go through it for 1 - 2 weeks, yes, very uncomfortable. I also suffered it. But this is not a reason to discourage someone to take the medication he was prescribed for his illness.

Not to mention, he is not you. He/She might not experience the same things you did.

"Depression in relationships. Did you leave? Would you return? Hello,

My (now ex) SO has been diagnosed with depression. We have had a wonderful relationship built upon many common interests and values, and family blending. He pursued me, and we both wanted a serious committment. 

He admitted he felt depressed to me 2 months ago, when I asked him why we had been struggling to do outside things together. There are a few large situational stressors in his life atm, but he had not expressed the severity of some of these to me until now.

I feel I see the worst of it, but friends get his 'all fine here' mask. Family seem to see more of it too, but they also come across quite critical which I feel makes him withdraw more.

* He seems to not be able to make plans in advance anymore, even of a few days, meaning I cannot clarify if we will see each other until hours/late at night the day before. I have asked him what we could do to make this easier, work with how he thinks etc but he has not suggested anything. 
* When I am visiting him, he is often engrossed in his cellphone, or just wants to watch TV in bed. The feel of absence hurts, but I try to co-exist and just be there. I have expressed this can be upsetting, and that idm if we do our own things together, but I need some of our time to be more about us interacting. This has been up and down, with things having seemed better lately.
* He has become more irritable, sometimes snapping at me or just seeming short all day. I can't seem to get anything right. 
* I feel like we are always having a conversation through a different filter. I could be talking about something abstract, and he will somehow interpret it as a criticism. eg. the other day I had mentioned a friend bought new clothes for her partner as he was in need of some replacements, and SO took this as a sly comment at him to update his own wardrobe. 
* I try to do nice things for him, leaving notes, bringing comfort items, making food, offering to talk if he needs to. He never wants to talk, and the nice things seem to leave little impact after an hour.
* The task of organising our time together is mostly mine, I have asked he share more of this how he can, such as both of us deciding on food options sometimes or suggesting something to do (just home stuff like movies) but this seems to have caused more strain despite him saying he was happy to do it.
* He has admitted he struggles to discuss his own feelings but also told me he will always be honest, which is now untrue as he seems unable to do so. 
* When I try to talk about my feelings on a matter (related or unrelated) he tends to get frozen up and doesnt say much. If it involves him in any way, he has been snapping more and recently and told me he does not have to talk about things just because I want to. I was hurt.

Things took a turn recently, and he ended it. I was confused, as things had been on the up that week. He had started meds a few weeks prior, and had a promotion. 

He said he doesn't know if we fit together but cannot explain why, then that it was actually him because he cannot sustain a relationship right now, then that he doesn't know who he is and just wants to be alone to figure himself out and cannot see ahead of himself or focus. But said he loves me and thinks I deserve better.

I don't know what to think. Is this typical of anyone else's experience with depression and their SO? If so, what did you feel when it was you? Did you come back to your partner if your symptoms improved or you recieved working treatment? 

I have been depressed before, but recovered with treatment, however I can see all our experiences will differ and how people react to a partner will not always be the same. It manifested differently for me, so I am seeking insight and advice on how to proceed.",1

"Why would i even bother anymore? it is litterally proven by biology and psychology, that peoples subconscious mind automatically sees asymmetrical faces as ugly. I had 1 chance of living a healthy and happy life, and all of this have i miserably failed at just because god or who knows decided for me to have an asymmetrical face. WHY FKN ME???. I come from a pretty city with pretty people. Everyone is happy, besides me. And this is much worse than people think. My eyes, my jaw, my forehead, my cheekbones. ITS LITTERALLY 2 DIFFERENT FACES, WITH DIFFERENT HEIGHT AND SIZE. Idk even know what caused this. Maybe i was born with it? Or because of my teeth or my posture???? IDK. Why should not i just kill myself? Yes i have BDD aswell, but I am completely aware of my situation. I completely now what my face looks like, and i know why it is ugly. Anyone born with my face would already have killed themselfs, or later in life. Living with this deformity is not worth it. Attractiveness is everything i ever wanted in life. Attractiveness is litterally the recipe for happiness. If i cannot be attractive, i do not want to exist. NO ONES knows how i feel. Asymmetrical development of the skull, is the sickest fkn mental torture to a person. I have never in my 18 years of living, seen someone as Asymmetrical as myself. So honestly, why should not i just kill myself? what is the point of living with this deformity? And i know if someone tells me ""I am beautiful"", i know they are lying. Because it is fucking proven by science that my face is UGLY. I already accepted that i will properly kill myself in the future. Who would not with the worst assymetrical face in the history of existence?. If a doctor could fix my face with me having a 1% chance of survival, i would do it 100%. Getting a 1% chance of living just 1 day with a asymmetrical face is my dream. I cannot live like this anymore. People call me ugly. Science call me ugly. I call myself ugly. And the only thing i want in life is to be attractive. So what is really the point of me existing? Not worth living with an asymmetrical face.",1

"Oh anxiety, you are weird sometimes. 6 to 7 years ago I was diagnosed with GAD/PTSD. 2 years ago I was diagnosed with adhd. I have managed it all this time with no medicine, and I have been fine with for the most part. The only time my anxiety would rise a little bit is when it was triggered by stress. Which then I knew I just had to balance it out again.

Well, this month ended up with heighten anxiety due to an allergic reaction being around seafood, one week later got a tooth pulled, 2 days later I was fussed at by an ER doctor, and then one week later after that I had anxiety reflux kick back so hard that it cause two days of back to back panic attacks. My anxiety was so bad that I couldn’t eat anything but rice and chicken, no meds, and being around doctors frighten me. I couldn’t manage to get myself out of that anxiety loop. 

Well I was finally about to get some hydroxyzine  for “as needed dosage” 3 weeks later. My anxiety was down back to a manageable level but my fears were still there. I took one 25 mg pill in the evening. I got an euphoria feeling and drowsiness the whole next day along with diarrhea. Then all my anxiety was gone. I can eat food again without fear. I’m not scared to take meds again. 

This is the weirdest Anxiety is the moment I have ever dealt with. However, I’m now pondering if with my anxiety reflux being kicked up it had my stomach and brain a relay lap so when I took the hydroxyzine it suppressed that nerve in my stomach and it help my stomach feel better and then which stop the relay cycle. I guess that is something I will have to remember to ask my doctor.",2
"Having a bit of a health scare right now, could use some help making sure this doesn't spiral out of control. Hi everyone, new here, but could use some help.

I am a 27 year old male.  I have a history of health anxiety/hypochondria and I also have an undiagnosed chronic inflammatory pain condition.  I also have GERD and barrett's esophagus.

I stopped taking the prilosec I was taking for my GERD and also haven't been to a doctor in about 4 or 5 years to get an endoscopy.  For those of you who don't know Barrett's Esophagus is a precancerous condition.   This is also where the concern comes in.

I drink pretty heavily, not everyday, but definitely on weekends, and I also smoke socially.

Leading up to New Year's I started noticing that I could feel liquids going down into my stomach a little more than usual.  This was a little alarming, then my GERD started getting worse.  Then I started having problems swallowing and then I completely lost my appetite.  I've been struggling with appetite loss and swallowing problems for a couple weeks now.

Now when you google the symptoms these are all common symptoms of Esophageal cancer.  This is where the fun has begun.  I don't know where the cycle started, but I am thoroughly convinced I have cancer at this point.  

I've made a doctor's appointment to my primary, and asked for a referral to a Gastroenterologist.   Gastroenterologist office says they are ""reviewing my file"" so I can't make an appointment yet. This concerns me, dont want to jump through hoops because part of my file is missing. 

In the meantime, I'm just trying to get through the days.  Super hungry, but zero appetite so I've been forcing myself to eat which is awful.   But I also feel like I've been worrying myself to death thinking it's cancer and spending time on my phone ""researching"".  

What can I do?  Tonight I was going to take a xanax, turn my phone off and watch a movie to try and calm myself down, but I didn't end up doing that.  I just ended up looking at more esophageal cancer stuff.  

How do I stop worrying about this until I get my doctor appointments.  It might be a month or two at this rate before I get an endoscopy!  ",2

I’m struggling with depression and anxiety along with chronic back and neck pain. I’m currently on temporary disability for the past five months. I’ve been doing therapy with a therapist every week, plus physical therapy. I’m also on medication for depression/anxiety for over a year. My symptoms haven’t changed.

I am dealing with anxiety about traveling and going outside my house. I’m working on it with a therapist and it is slow going.

At this point though maybe that is preferable to how I am now, although my psychiatrist will probably never prescribe one to me again. Every day I come home and I try to get things done. What ends up happening is I collapse on the couch, my bed, or the floor in my room and stare off into space. I have no energy. Sometimes I have thoughts, sometimes I do not. I can picture a miniature me banging against my skull trying to get me to move or do something, literally anything, and I cannot. Have you guys felt this way too? These feelings are different than the crash depression that comes after mania - but perhaps it is still depression? Although I have been depressed before but this feels different. Maybe its obvious, I am sorry - but I have a lot of difficulty understanding my emotions. I have tried therapy but they just assume things. Maybe its like adhd depression or something? Or adhd making things worse? But I have no motivation whatsoever. Things that are sad or stressful happen and I am completely emotionless. At work when things get fast paced I completely dissociate and I feel like I am in a dream. And if I do cry, it stops and the emotions switch off.

With my family I am irritable and I am convinced they hate me more each day. Well, I hate me more each day too. They wonder how I can be taking my medication and still be this way.

"Some days ago I decided to stop masturbating and watching porn because I think I was addicted to it, after that I sleep better, I have more energy and more of those ""positive things"", but I just realized, what have changed since I stopped? nothing, I am lonely, I am miserable and I am still a worthless piece of shit. there is no woman in the earth that would love me, so there is any benefit in stop masturbating? I am just stopped having that self pleasure and that false feeling of having a loot of partners to fuck, maybe I am a little more healthier now, but not more happy so what is the point?Maybe I should keep watching porn, anyway it is impossible for me to even talk to a girl, and after all the porn I have watched I do not think I can even be satisfied with a normal relationship because I was into hardcore stuff.I am sorry if something here does not make sense, I am not a native English speaker, just wanted to vent out here where nobody knows me.

"My father is in his mid-50s. he is been unemployed for two years now due to his depression, agoraphobia, and pride. he is currently running out of money and struggling to live a healthy life.

I believe those things broke him and he has not been able to recover. Even now I know he is sitting in the old house that I grew up in alone with the lights off to save electricity.

"I have had larger amounts of stress happen compared to now, but it feels like I have only now caved from it. I left my job about two years ago to take care of my dad while I was in school. It was hell watching him get worse without being able to do anything. I still managed to stay on top of my grades and responsibilities. He passed months ago. Nothing seemed right after, but I had to carry out his will, handle his funeral, etc. so it kept me from just sitting with my thoughts. About a week later I found out my SO was cheating with his kids mom. My grades slipped that semester, but I got them back up and got a new job. Continued repeatedly dealing with shady behavior from SO and being promised change. My mom chose this period of time to behave like she had not in years, disappeared when she met a guy and does not really come around, and cancels when I have tried to come see her. My parents divorced when I was young, she was not close with my dad.These past few weeks I feel I have let myself go. I was struggling with my classes and have just stopped working on them, not even checking the grades. Letting my ex/not ex SO continue to be around despite asking them to let me heal and move on. they have been attentive and loving and stopped drinking but it does not feel the same anymore. I do not think its fair to them because I do not have hope that were going to last and I do not know that I even feel sad about that after giving so many chances. Its not healthy for either of us when there is no trust. I procrastinate all responsibilities, and do not really see myself with a good future anymore, just getting through each day. I feel the panic of how bad I am messing up but will not do anything to start fixing it. I have just mentally checked out from everything aside from my job. I am not sure I want to see a doctor because I fear they will just send me on a journey of different medications to try. Even small tasks like calling a doctor seem strenuous. I do not want to talk to anyone I know about this because I know every person is dealing with their own problems, and cannot really help with mine anyway. Just needed to get this off my chest.

"I have fried my nervous system! How to get back sensitivity? Cant Feel anything, not even myself

Sorry for posting so much, but i Feel like my actual soul and presence is gone from my body. Like literally just burned away. 

I Feel i have emotional numbness, like actual numbness. I have emotions mentally some times, but my body and brain is like physically numb so i cant Feel them. 

I Sometimes get hints of emotions in my body, but it is also distant and numb. And i cant Feel it.

My body is just a body, and i am just a mental voice. There is no presence or life anymore. 

I have no emotion or feeling of anything. 

All feelings left, and the last to go was the feeling of myself. 

Music and food and the sun and my Friends. All gone and no feeling. How can i Feel music if i cant even Feel myself. 

No desires, or motivation or sadness or love. Just nothingness. 

I had a physical feeling that my brain was empty, like a physical feeling of a room inside my head, like my brain
Like you can physically Feel your brain is empty. This feeling is also gone. I cant Feel my brain.

Mine went away, and now i dont have much in my head of thougts emotions and feelings.

My memory is complete crap. 

I live life in this strange 2D without any feeling or emotion. 

I dont know if a constant state of hyperarousal and OCD might have fried my brain. Also bad reaction to B12!

I think my nervous system is severly desensetized!! How can i make it more sensitive again?

Anyone else experience this and get better? Like they cant even Feel themselves?",3
"Years of living on survival mode? its been tough on you, no one shares your feelings or feel your pain, you are all alone, and the world is only pushing you to the edge every single day, you are tired, just want to sleep to forget, to get out of the reality that surrounds you, no matter how many times you try to take your mind off of your trauma, your agony or your numbness. The poisonous what if hunts you every moment, the why and the why me. Waking up at night, thinking if all this been a dream, this cannot happen to me, I am not where I am, takes you a minutes to realize your reality, To put yourself to sleep every night wishing not to wake up again, then you remember that one person that you do not want hurt by leaving, or the people that their existence and well-being depends on your presence. You have tried everything, you avoided everyone, maybe even forced yourself to laugh and smile to give those around you the fake sign that you are alright, You know you hurt many, close ones and strangers, just because you do not have the ability to deal with emotions or events, sometimes you think how to make it up to countless of people when you get out of this reality, dreaming of better times where you can make yourself and others safe and happy. let us stop the time, now , Cry if you can, its okay to cry, let some tears wash a little of your agony, pray if you believe in praying, there is no single path to healing , but i know healing will come, for me and for you, you will look at those days with silence, no regret, nothing but emptiness. You will find what you been struggling for without effort, Sometimes the universe like to play with us by making the path of simple things difficult when we mix our desire with fear, amplifies all the negativity into events, But that is enough for now. Just want to tell you that I am cheering for you, and we will be alright. From the heart to the heart",1

w/ studies:

She's in her 3rd year of college right now and apparently in one of her subjects, they only have 2 exams per semester and she's failed both of those exams, last Tuesday was the second and it's been fucking her up so much. She did an assignment, a plate (cause she's in engineering), she asked from another block what the problem was 3 days ago, but she found out this afternoon from her classmate that the professor changed one detail in the problem that would change the ENTIRE equation, she couldn't pass it in time.

"Long story short, I have (23F) been feeling very low recently. I have struggled with mental health issues in the past, but nothing that has ever properly affected life to the point of wanting to just disappear. I work 40 hours a week, the usual. I have a long distance boyfriend who I have been with for almost 3 years; very happy with him etc. I do enjoy my job for the most part, which I am very lucky to have. Over the last month, I have realised I am just not myself. Have been feeling incredibly low, agitated, just generally like life is pointless and I am never going anywhere. I hate this as I am not a sad person and normally can get myself out of a rut. I have been distancing myself from my friends and just staying home as much as I can, as its the only place i feel completely safe and somewhat happy. I received news today that my partner is being deployed to a different country and I will not be able to see him for 6 months. This has completely broke me and sent me over the edge. I found out in work this morning and have been a mess ever since. I work in an office alone (covid) so none of my coworkers can actually tell I am a mess. But even though this news could be the reason I am so sad, it would not explain how sad I have felt recently and how I have reacted. I am genuinely just at a loss, terrified I am going to feel like this forever. Terrified to go to the doctors, as they have never taken me seriously. Terrified to tell my boss as I feel like he will not take me seriously. I guess I am just looking for some advice on what/where/who to go to? Am I Depressed?",1

"I am just so tired and alone and never thought Id really be typing on fucking Reddit but I am just all alone. Unless you have time Id probably just leave this post. it will probably be long and Ill probably immediately delete it anyways. Alone is a really weird feeling because how can you be alone while technically surrounded? Well as someone who has a family who has a couple friends I have no one that I can express myself with. I have no one and nothing. I was going years of not telling anyone anything of the about my mental health and just trying and trying to believe what my dad said everything is mental. Even if that is true it does not mean you can control it. They way I think and how I rationalize things has lead me to be so alone. I am sure there is so much more but I feel like it comes from that. From me being too scared to tell anyone anything in fear of them leaving me more alone that I already am. I feel as I am a she will of myself because I am expected to be this person I have spent years and years faking in order to be accepted and liked and wanted and its not me its a form of everything I think I needed to be and I feel as if I am trapped in my own body. Any time I ever express real feelings I end up hurting someone or someone elses feelings. Right now everything in my body is screaming to stop typing and delete this but if I do that then what. I am already here. I apologize for anything and everything I do even before I do it just out of fear of not being liked and wanted and being alone but then I pause and start to think I have never been liked or wanted its only even beeen the fake me.I was with my ex for 3 years and after a lot of research and trying to self heal I have learned the term grooming and learned that was done to me. Out of a sense of love and obligation I allowed myself to basically be stripped of anything good about me or anything I liked or had any interest in in order to be loved and liked to have a family. Long story short I lost myself and I did not talk to any friends or family for 3 years and after getting back to them I feel as if I am always auditioning and I am back to doing anything just to have someone around me but now I know that I am not being liked for me and anytime I ever show anything that is truly me I somehow validate my negative thoughts and rationalize them to be right and I know that is wrong but I am 24/7 screaming in my head fighting with thoughts and screaming at me to stop and begging just for some help and weed barely helps anymore. I do not want to drink but drinking is about the only time now when I do not feel sad. And I am able to literally drown out the thoughts. And i cry everytime I think about anything because I now know how sad Thais all is and the fact that no one knows except i started telling my mom a tiny bit about the negative thoughts and voices and now all I can think about is how me telling her worried her and scared her and I hate myself even more now and I genuinely did not think that was possible. The problem is, that I do not think I am ad guy or anything like I played plenty of sports growing up and had lots of friends and was popular I guess I had plenty of girlfriends and was actually liked by people and friends but I do not where that went I do not feel like him I do not feel me. I literslly do not feel like me. The only time I ever do is en I am all alone like iwatch videos or listen to music loud enough to anyone can hear it so that thEy do not think I am weird or I do not honestly even know I just do not want to be alone anymore I want to be liked and wanted for me and I do not see that happening ever. I feel too much pressure to even talk to anyone let alone be around them for longer than a passing by. I feel as If I am being shown pity anytime anyone talks to me or is around me. I feel as if its all just to make me feel better. Vs actually wanting to be around me for me. I do not think I am good anymore and I think its over honestly. I am just so tired of everything and the pressures and the feelings that come with literally opening my mouth or being around anyone. If I am not alone I cannot laugh without crying on the inside. I literally stop myself from laughing or feeling good by non stop negative thoughts pounding in my head and I scream and scream stop and help but I cannot get them out. I rationalize all of them and believe them to be logical and true and I am even in more pain that I am already in. I am so tireeeed please help actually I do not need help I just want to be wanted? No one understand the person I am. I try to express myself at times and it only ever leads to others getting hurt from my feelings. I feel as if I am not good enough anymore unless I am alone but I am tired of being alone. Alone is painful alone is basically like being around 2849472937293637494 people who hate you and are telling you why at every second and thinking that everyone hates you or that they pity you or doing a favor or anything. I spend every waking moment trying to make others happy because when I do that I can at least know that for that second that person knows that it was ME that made them happy. And its getting to the point where I am running out of energy for everything I can barely finish laughs I can barely be in a public setting especially not sober. I am sorry for burdening everyone with this I could have kept going but its getting hard to type with all the tears. I hope everyone is okay always if anyone needs any help please let me know Ill do whatever I can to help somebody not feel any percent of this. I seriously will. Idk why I am even typing this.",1

"WARNING: graphic. Stomach Flu, Food Poisoning, or neither? Hello,

last night after going out with my boyfriend to get Mongolian Grill, I got back to his house and my head began hurting like a migraine. What was even worse is a few minutes later, my stomach started feeling weird. I brushed it off and was able to ignore it, however, normally if it is nothing or I am having motion sickness, it dies down after a while. It did not. I began feeling REALLY nauseous, and just plain weird. I was also having a lot of small burps and...gas down there. So then I thought, must be gas as this has happened before. 3 hours go by, and I literally cannot move or I feel like I am going to throw up. We go to his mom’s house, and I try to lay down and sleep. And then I got that feeling maybe 30 minutes later, went to the bathroom, and puked up all of my food. I have never puked so much in my life. It hurt really bad, and to make it worse every 30mins-1hr after that I threw up 8 more times, as you can imagine I got ZERO sleep. It has now been about 5 hours since I threw up, and I feel absolutely fine. My stomach does feel a little raw, as expected. But I am able to sip gatorade and suck on ice chips right now with zero desire to eat. 
This is where things get nastier: about 20 minutes ago I was laying here kind of sitting up, and I felt gas down there so I obviously decided to let it out. Worst mistake because, I SUDDENLY FELT IT WAS WET DOWN THERE. And boy, was it.
I ran full speed to the restroom, and it turns out to be what appeared as a mixture of super watery diarrhea, and vomit. Absolutely disgusting, I showered and here I am now.  hours ago before the last few times I puked I did have to poop, it was weird it came out of nowhere and I went and it was big and soft. And then this!
What makes my boyfriend’s mom suspect it is the stomach flu is because my boyfriend’s sister’s boyfriend threw up the other night too, however, she didn’t get sick, I was nowhere near him, and he had a concussion. I don’t have a fever either (atleast I don’t think I do)?
I feel like food poisoning is the culprit because I have had it before and this same thing happened, besides the bathroom situation from what I remember. Just constant throwing up over and over again. I did eat a lot of lettuce and spinach, so I hope it isn’t e-coli.

Any advice would be appreciated. ",2

"An Arrow To The Knee Hello everyone! 

Recently, I have been going through a bout of health anxiety due to a nasty head cold. Lots of dizziness and headaches have been fueling my worries, making me feel very disconnected and depressed. I have been constantly worrying that this will never end or that something more serious is going on.

Earlier today, I was starting to have a bit of a panic/anxiety attack so I decided to go for a drive and clear my head while listening to some music. I ended up driving to a park, watching the sun set, and taking a walk, which really helped me regain focus on reality and calm down. Luckily, on my evening stroll I found a fence with some graffiti reading “Let It Be” which reminded me of a lesson my old therapist gave me. I think it could help a lot of people on this sub.

She used to compare any condition or small symptom causing worry to being hit with an arrow.  *cue Skyrim guard life story* Going ahead and excessively worrying about the first arrow, to the extent that many of us do, is like shooting yourself with another arrow.  I am already suffering from a sinus infection, why would I then exacerbate my anxiety by worrying about it more than I should? This could extend to anything we worry about, a headache, a sore stomach, etc. Don’t let a small, insignificant symptom we are dealing with create more issues, just let it be and it will pass. That headache you think is brain cancer, will go away! That leg twitch you think is early signs of ALS, will go away! Don’t take an arrow to the knee from life and shoot yourself with another. 

I hope this helps some people’s worries!",2

"Please do not judge me for what you are about to read in this post.I am in a relationship, and am about to see my boyfriend (whom I love) for the first time in 1.5 years, but I keep talking to other people on dating apps. I do not agree to meet anyone. Mostly exchanging banter and small talk. Some light flirting.Why do I do it? I do not know. I am not the cheating type. In fact, I got cheated on by an ex-boyfriend, someone I almost married. Multiple times. It pretty much destroyed my ability to trust anyone (until I met my current - and look how I am ruining it now, just before our long-awaited reunion).For the past month or so I have avoided all my friends, except for my best friend - agreed to see her only once. I have only gone out on walks alone, gone to bookshops and coffee shops alone. it is normally what I love, but now I find myself questioning why I do it, why I feel the need to always be alone. Today the answer came to me, all of a sudden. Because when you are alone, no one can ever hurt you. I do not know who hurt me, anyway. But I am starting to realise that I have committed to being alone because - well, I AM alone. I have always been alone.I turn 28 this year, the year that my parents had their first kid. I cannot picture a future that has anyone by my side. there is just nothing there. Every love I have ever had - gone, broke my heart, moved on. Love is so fleeting. what is left but the broken pieces desperately trying to become one again? What can I do to heal but to accept that I can count on no one but myself, in the end?My boyfriend is sweet, and loving, and kind - but I cannot give him a happy and free life, because -I- am not free. he is also so much younger and has so much else to see. he is not going to want me once he grows up a little more. I can only love him in the meantime.I honestly do not know what I am saying. Feels like rambling TBH. All I know is that I cannot think of a single person who is always been -my person-. And that were it not for the fact that I have an 8 year old niece, I might not bother trying to keep living anymore. there is all this emptiness inside that I cannot make any sense of. I am living half of myself - I can never marry a woman - and only now am I realising just how much it is destroying me. Extremely alone and cut off from the world. And the stupidest part is that I actively choose to stay away from people",1

Horror movies are one of the best examples of this. When you’re watching a horror movie about ghosts, zombies, serial killers, aliens, or monsters, your nervous system naturally kicks into gear as if you’re experiencing a real threat from your environment.

**This** [**fight, flight, or freeze**](https://www.theemotionmachine.com/the-complete-guide-to-daily-stress/)**-response creates a biochemical rush of adrenaline, endorphins, and dopamine, which can create a type of “natural high.”**

However, while your body experiences the “natural high” of a real threat, your brain knows deep down that you’re actually safe and secure – and there’s no real danger present.

One early [study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00995932) published in the journal *Motivation and Emotion* looked into why people enjoy eating really spicy foods (such as chili peppers) and found a similar response.

Chili enjoyers still feel the same irritation and pain of eating spicy foods as everyone else, but they enjoy the rush of adrenaline and endorphins it produces. It stimulates the body’s “warning system” in a harmless and risk-free way that can be exciting and exhilarating.

This type of [positive thrill-seeking](https://www.theemotionmachine.com/positive-thrill-seeking/) can be found in many other relatively safe and harmless activities, such as riding rollercoasters, extreme sports, skydiving, an intense workout, or playing competitive video games.

**New psychology research shows that the experience of negative emotions (in a safe and controlled context) can be very enjoyable and beneficial.**

One [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30307264/) published in the scientific journal *Emotion* found that “voluntarily arousing negative emotions” (VANE) – such as purposely making ourselves scared – can lead to an overall boost in mood, like when we watch a horror movie or visit a haunted house.

The study looked at individuals who bought tickets for an “extreme haunted house” event, which was designed to elicit a variety of negative emotions such as anxiety, fear, shock, and disgust.

After the “haunted house” experience, most individuals reported an overall boost in euphoria and positive mood, especially if they felt tired, bored, or stressed beforehand.

While the sample is biased (people who buy tickets to haunted houses are more likely to enjoy them), the study does reveal that some people genuinely enjoy scaring themselves.

Furthermore, the study found that individuals who enjoyed the haunted house experience also showed less stress while completing subsequent cognitive and emotional tests (including showing less reactivity in the brain during those tests, as measured by EEG recordings).

Researchers theorize that “voluntarily arousing negative emotions” (VANE) can teach us how to better deal with future stress and anxiety.

This is a common technique behind a lot of *exposure therapy*, where a person is gradually put into a fearful situation so they become more “desensitized” to some irrational fear or phobia. For example, a person scared of flying may be asked by a therapist to visualize themselves getting on a plane until they learn to manage their fear better.

By actively exposing ourselves to fear, shock, or disgust in a safe and controlled way, we get to practice regulating these emotions in the moment, which is an important pillar of [emotional intelligence](https://www.theemotionmachine.com/4-fundamental-pillars-of-emotional-intelligence/).

**Horror movies** ***simulate*** **extraordinary experiences that we normally wouldn’t have in the real world. When we watch a horror movie, we put ourselves in the protagonist’s position and ask ourselves,** ***“What would I do in this situation?”***

New research shows fans of horror movies may even be more prepared to face real-world catastrophes.

One fascinating [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7492010/) published in *Personality and Individual Differences* discovered that fans of “horror movies” and “pandemic movies” were more resilient during the COVID pandemic. It was also found that fans of “prepper” genres in particular (alien-invasion, apocalyptic, and zombie films) exhibited both greater resilience and preparedness.

This is one reason why “pandemic” movies such as *Contagion* and *28 Days Later* showed a huge spike in popularity during COVID.

Ultimately, horror movies give us a chance to face our fears and practice [mentally rehearsing](https://www.theemotionmachine.com/mental-rehearsal-changing-habits-through-the-power-of-visualization/) how we would respond in extremely intense situations. As the famous horror writer Stephen King once said, “A good horror story help us understand our own deepest fears.”",3

"yesterday, I almost had sex with someone. but when it was happening, I felt only halfway there. and now my memory of it is hazy, and when I try to think about it I don't see it from my perspective, I see it from like above me. like it wasn't *actually*happening to me.

"Hello fellow sufferer. This year hit hard, it is not the first time I am struggling in my life but this lockdown and isolation stuff has knocked me out and off my path.Not only am I lost. I cannot sleep anymore. If I go to bed at night, I can fall asleep perfectly fine but my sleep is light and I wake up after several hours exhausted and tiered. My days are filled with tiredness and I have little to no energy. Getting my life together will take a while but I really need to sleep in order to get my life together. I already tried melatonin (+ valerian + hop) 1-3mg at night which helps getting sleepy, but not sleeping through the whole night. Hesitant to take SSRI and/or benzos though.

"I have spent the vast majority of my life severely depressed. I have always felt like a loner, desperately wanting to connect to others but with no idea on how other people do it.

"I do not know any communities where being sad but not exactly depressed. Like I do not feel like shit all the time or for long periods of time, just in bursts like a mild depressed state.Whenever I get in these states, I tend to think of how much I hate my life(but I do not). I do not really feel the need to commit suicide or have a strong desire too but I do think about it, I guess often but have never tried it. Maybe I am in denial but I am never talking to some therapist or even friends and family about my personal issues. I try to keep my thoughts and emotions private and confined. One thing I do feel is, I have an intense desire to be alone. I feel fake, like forced happiness everyday to talk to friends and my family. I just want to be alone, for a long time. Sometimes, I wish I had the balls to run away and disappear or just move out. But no, I continue to sit at home each day, playing video games and watching youtube as I have cheated on every assignment and test since I have started college. I really do not know what to do with my life, I know I am a failure but I will not feel terrible tommorow. I could die tonight and I hope I am forgotten as quickly as possible, I do not want anyone to know except whoever has too.But I will just be better in the morning and go along with life until I hit another depressed mood. Does anyone know what this condition is because I do not think its depression depression? I am not depressed just sad",1
"Hello! I am looking for support or just anyone who is kind enough to read through this post, and I really wanted to share about my struggles with depression and get of out this really dark place that I am in right now. I believe that I may have high-functioning depression (although I do want to diagnose myself), everything looks fine on the outside and I seem to be doing well, but I am really struggling on the inside. I feel really lonely, unloved, unappreciated, and most of all empty and hallow. I feel like an empty she will of a person, who has no sense of self and has no interests/hobbies/passions about anything in life. Everyday is the same boring monotony, and I do not feel motivated or have the energy to change my routine because I am so unhappy with the way my life has turned out and the people around me.I had a relatively good and happy childhood, however things started to get worse as I became a teenager. I was diagnosed with ADD when I was in middle school, I come from an immigrant family with very conservative values, and I never able to get the help that I needed for it. I struggled a lot in school and had poor grades, which I think caused me to spiral into a deep depression/anxiety. I have been struggling since I was 12/13 and I am now 24. I have also suffered a lot of abuse at the hands of my family members and the trauma has completely shattered my self-esteem and self-worth, which further made the depression/anxiety I was experiencing, exponentially worse. I definitely think my toxic upbringing/environment and not getting help for my ADD made things worse for my mental health. I now work at a Fortune 100 tech company, and I constantly feel unworthy and that I do not deserve this amazing opportunity. I do not have the confidence, and upbeat personality all of my coworkers seem to have.I have no support system, no friends, no relatives, except my immediate family. I am surrounded by my coworkers who are all in relationships, have a solid friend group, relatives, etc. they are surrounded by all of the love and support in the world, while I feel like I have wasted my life due to my unfortunate situation and years of trauma and depression. I feel like the people around me are so much luckier, they had it easier and I know they will go far in life and their careers. I cry every night because I am so terrified of my future, I have no friends at all and feel like no one cares about me. Dying of loneliness. :( I want to move out and live on my own but I am scared and the depression has been making it hard to find the motivation to get things done. Most importantly, I want to stay away from the toxic and negative people in my life.I do not want to feel like there is no hope in my life, no bright future for me. I do not want the people or the circumstances in my life to define me or break me down. I know I deserved better! How can someone who has no interests or hobbies and is very depressed such as myself, connect with other people and make friends? I would like to make long-term meaningful friends not just acquaintances or superficial connections.Thank you for reading my post all the way through! :) In a dark place right now, support would be appreciated :)",1

"Anger boiling over Hi everyone! I’m struggling a lot lately and I’m hoping some of y’all have tips for me.

Life has been hard lately and my stress is manifesting as anger. I keep telling people I’m entering my villain era because this is so abnormal for me. I am so frustrated at work because everything is falling on my shoulders while my boss stays lazy. I have low tolerance for stupid behavior and am calling people on their sh*t. My VP laughed at me when I tried to bring up an issue recently and I rage cry when I think about it. I’m finding myself being short with my friends and acting entirely self centered.

This isn’t normal for me. I normally tolerate so much. I am compassionate and so empathetic and normally look to help everybody, and I’m just burnt out. I know it’s stress/anxiety.

For a little context that I know is playing into it all: I just weaned off depression and anxiety meds around Christmas. My grandma died in January. My dad has cancer and is very sick right now. I just learned someone I work closely with was a suspect in a murder that remains a cold case….

I feel like I’m falling apart and I need advice of how to bring myself back. What do I do? How do I stop feeling so mad? Thank you ❤️",3
"What's going on with me 22F.
Last year had been so weird. I graduated. Fucked a relationship up. Didn't cheat but the ex couldn't take that I slept with someone else. He was broken so I spiraled guilty anxious lonely. Also I was preparing for a big test I cared a lot. I used to be worried, cried all day. Then snap. I feel nothing. I'm sleeping all day when I go towards the books I'm like why. I'm so numb. Psychiatrist diagnosed me with atypical depression and gave me pills which I'm not allowed to take coz mom says there will be side effects. 
Today I was allowed to ride a bike. I hit a car and fell down. It was a minor accident but bro. I realized I felt nothing after that. Nothing at all. This couldn't have been me. I was a girl who was afraid to ride  bikes I used to freak out so much now I just don't care. Not even the fact that I'm able to ride the bike. If it was the earlier me I'd feel goosebumps with a sense of achievement, I'd feel fear anxious and scared about the accident. What's wrong with me I feel as though I'm an empty floating balloon.",1
"Extreme fatigue. Anyone else relate? For the past 5 months my fatigue has been very overwhelming. Worst I've felt in all my life. My symptoms are fatigue, malaise (generally feeling unwell), light body aches randomly, not all the time, very tired, sometimes my body feels heavy and unbalanced, which then triggers anxiety because I fear I might pass out. It's so bad I can't focus on life or work. I struggle daily to get out of bed.

Few facts about me. I'm 27, 171lbs, white male, 5'10"", fitbit tells me I get around 6.5-7 hours of sleep per night, I eat alright (should eat more veggies), I got a cubicle job without windows, I drive 1 hour total per day for work. I don't excercise much, mainly light walking with my dog or in hallways at work, I suffer from depression and anxiety, I stopped taking the 5mg Lexapro cold turkey after being on it for 5 years, 2 months or so after I stopped the symptoms and fatigue started, I reinstated 0.5mg Lexapro using liquid solution made from water. I have only had 1 blood tests in my life at age 26 and I didn't fast. They found my vit d was 20ml but everything else checked out.

I want to die. I feel like death. If there is a God please show me mercy. ",2
"Developed anxiety disorder out of the blue Don’t understand why this is happening, but I have been having panic attacks when I’m stressed out. It’s really weird. I do struggle with depression (diagnosed but not medicated) but never really had an issue with anxiety until now.


I can only pinpoint one specific traumatic moment this year, but I really am not seeing why, especially when the trigger isn’t anything related to that. I just shut down now under *any* stress :( which sucks because sometimes my work is stressful and the panic attacks have happened twice in my work place


I'm just wondering if anyone else had this sudden onset of panic attacks for no reason?

EDIT: I forgot to mention but I’m in therapy and have mentioned this to my therapist but I am finding these episodes continuing to occur and it scares me",2

Scared to death of some wierd symptoms. Greetings. I have extreme health anxeity. For some time i have had troubles with floaters that looked like spiderweb. Recently these past weeks i have also noticed stars in my eyes. They seem to appear randomly and they also move with my eyes similar to floaters. They appear for some seconds then they disapear. I wen't to the eye doctor and he told me that i had PVD or occular migraine. He also told me that my right pupil was smaller then the left one so he called some neurologist and he did some tests but there was nothing wrong with them. But right now im starting to belive that he was wrong and that i have some super rare eye disease or maybe a brain tumor. Should i go back to the doctor or should i take his word that it is nothing serious?,2
"Does anyone every feel like laughing at memes or funny videos we find online is not satisfying at all? The more and more I do it the less I am satisfied that I am laughing at someone elses joke that they probably got from someone else. It is not real, its so fake, and that is why the joy you get from it feels so fake right?I just want to make my own difference in this world, and the depression jabs at me every time I do something that does not help another person.that is it, thanks for reading, here is to hopes that you all find ways to smile and thinks to be happy about!

Should I be worried about hickeys? Hi I’m already anxious about some things but now I’m really anxious because I got a few hickeys last night and one of them is really long and runs for about 2-3 inches down my neck. I read an article about two people who died from a blood clot that came from a hickey and I’m worried that because this one is so long that will happen to me too. They seem so innocent like just bruises but I’m freaking out. Does anyone know anything or should I be worried ,2
"No Matter how worthless and useless we feel,we always serve a purpose even if it is not the one we are searching for. I am 19 I am going through a phase where I do not know what to do with my life, I have not aged yet I have been through things and I have made mistakes, some I have learned from it, some I might repeat it. I am dealing with existential crisis as much as many do, some feels the whole point of existing is worthless and means nothing to the point they become nihilist it might affect them negatively and lead them to depression, or positively to optimism nihilism. I am writing this because I am getting anxious everytime I overthink things about life and existentialism. Though I have not experienced life yet since I am a teen maybe there is going to be times where it will change my mind and makes me happy, whoever this is not the point of the post I am was just introducing myself, I have been thinking about the functioning of our society and how we built our civilization, and I have come to the conclusion no matter how much we fool ourselves that we live for a reason and that we exist for a purpose but really we are nothing but like an ant colony (sorry I am not dehumanising anyone) by this analogy, I mean that we are like ants who are just working to serve our queen (which is our survival instincts)even if you are not happy with your Job or your life, you will be left with no choice but to work so our civilization can evolve and be built or you would end up in a psychiatric ward treated as a lab rat (again I am not trying to dehumanise) so psychopathology can evolve too, anyways I lack huge experience and lots of knowledge as I mentioned I am only 19 . I hope to whoever is reading this understand my point. I do not know whether I am insane or delusional due to this post or anything but it felt philosophical and depressive anyways I'mma go sleep have a goodnight or a good morning. No Matter how worthless and useless we feel,we always serve a purpose even if it is not the one we are searching for",1
"Hi my names Isaac and I am here to tell my story of depression, anxiety and stress. Currently I am 15 years old and these 3 sins somehow disrupted my body it all started through 1 strawberry edible in May 1st and my mom gave me Xanax for me to calm my self down from the edible and it worked because it knocked me out for the whole day. But the next day my left side of my chest was hurting bad and it scared me because it felt like a heart attack and I had a panic attack so I had to go to the hospital I got their they checked me out and my blood pressure was 180/120 but the doctors told me to calm down and gave me a pill and sent me on my way but the day after that my sides was hurting again and I was scared like I was going to have a heart attack again and then I went to the hospital again for the same reason the doctors did an EKG on my heart and they said everything was normal and my blood pressure was little high again I think it was 140 but then they sent me on my way again but If you guys did not know my parents are currently going thru a divorce too so yeah. But couple weeks later my left side of my chest still hurting but wait I start to get lightheaded more afton now and I had also got tested positive for COVID too now that is crazy shit. I got thru COVID and blah blah these symptoms still happening and there making me depressed because it scares me to think I have to live with these symptoms forever and I do not want to and it scares and makes me get depressed with life and i go to the doctors for this and she prescribed me serpentine and suggests I get counseling but I want to know your guys opinions plz lmk this stuff is eating me Alive Help me find my cure",1

"She was seventeen and they met in a hospital, he was in the drug rehab, she was in the mental hospital. She was 17, and he technically kidnapped her, running across the country. She immediately got pregnant with me, and he married her, at which point the law washed their hands of the matter. I was born premature, 5 months and 3 weeks, which in 1981 was very dangerous.

Not that is was possible before because of the fact that I am a young person with Supervisor and management experience within a large company, however even with that it does not count for anything because I apply for jobs lower than what I am qualified for but to employers I am ""too qualified for that position"" or I am ""not qualified enough"" when I apply for jobs I am qualified for due to being young, on top of that goodluck to me in finding a job that will even pay enough to survive on.I truly do not understand what I did wrong, I am not a bad person, I have tried so hard to help everyone I can and yet no one is ever there for me, this is all just a small brush over for some of my problems, I guess after all I had a bit to say.Thank you to however takes the time to read this and I apologise for any grammartical errors, I suppose I just want someone to know a little bit because it just helps to believe that. I just do not know what to do anymore",1

"I feel like I have to write this down to finally say something to myself outside of my damn thoughts. I am a 15 M and spent about 2 years putting on the happy face at school and pretending I was content to then spend the rest of my day home wishing I was not here, wishing I did not exist sometimes pretending I did not and imagining the happier life everyone else would have and how much better off they would be without me. These thoughts cloud my mind all to much and make me just want to disappear, I thought I had beat it and thought I was done then I fall back into the same depressive spiral of reasons I should not exist reasons why I am a fuck up. I heard this quote from my English teacher one time, life is suffering, suffering is what gives life meaning and he was right, everything ends all the good we have eventually becomes bad and we always pay a price. I keep falling into this hole and digging it deeper and I am sick of it, how do I fill the damn hole and pull myself out at the same time because I do not feel right and am sick of this, I do not understand what it takes to be fixed or if its possible. I have not cried in months and whenever I feel like it I become consumed with self anger and its reaction its not me but it is becoming me and I do not know how to stop it or what to do. Me",1

I am 16 and going to be a junior soon and I feel completely lost and like an overall waste of space. My gpa went down because of covid and compared to everyone else I feel like nothing. Everyone says that grades are not important and that they do not matter but how?? I have based my entire life around them and tried my hardest and to know that I still failed in the end and that everything I have worked for did not matter. I feel terrible about it. I feel like I have failed everyone. Especially my parents. I do not know what to do. I hate that I am not amazing like my friends or my cousin who does all these amazing things and still has great grades while I am struggling to wakeup and not end it all if I step back into school. I just feel lost. I want to disappear. I am so sick and tired of crying and feeling guilty for everything that I have done in my life. I do not know what to do. I feel completely lost,1
I think I may have finally had enough. I am completely broken right now and my mental state is not okay enough to deal with it. I do not want to kill myself. But I do not want to live. I am just waiting to see which one is stronger right now... This may be it,1

"I have been in this sink of depression for months.

A few months ago I broke up with my gf of 5 years for a lot of reasons. She was more career oriented, she chose it over me. I cannot be mad at someone for following their dreams but I was so hurt she chose to go to an out of state school, especially since already just up and left to work far away without talking with me about it. She then contacts me saying she is actually not going to an out of state school, but the school we talked about in the first place. But I cannot stand talking to her, she makes me so angry I fall into this rage filled depression. I am supposed to start school as a fire fighter at my local college.

"Back here again Damn colon cancer.

I'm afraid again and it seems more palpable than ever. This started two years ago after getting some blood work done. I got in my head that I could have colon cancer.

All my symptoms began after all results were good. I started having some light blood on my stool (a line here and there). Then my right lymph node grew, then shrunk, then grew and so on (it's still swollen but smaller). Then I started having diarrhea and watery dolls with a feeling of incomplete evacuation. Then I started noticing my skin is getting pale, more visible veins.(I sometimes see myself going from normal to pale to normal a couple of times in a day). I do the palmar crease pallor test almost constantly now.

I noticed that my fingernails were either pale or blue - ish sometimes (started thinking of iron deficiency and that scares the cap out of me).

Then I started feeling weaker, tired, after very little effort (should note that I put on 10 kg in this time). Arms started feeling weaker, got some armpit pain, chest pain, etc.

Then my back started hurting. My lower left back. Sometimes my lower right too. Then it started hurting more and more often. Now it hurts along my left leg as well as left hip. I read a post a while ago that said the op was diagnosed after very similar symptoms, so naturally I started freaking out again.

Now I'm seeing some similar stuff with my dad and it really drives me back to freaking out.

I don't know what to do anymore. I'm at the end of my rope. ",2

"I do not want to be spend my 20s worrying about my 30s. Being anxious about the rest of my life. I just want to be present. And I think I have been even giving myself anxiety thinking about my future so much. what is going to happen, when am I going to die, who am I going to marry. It has bombarded my thoughts and honestly has just been a weight. Truly life is uncontrollable. there is no way of trying to pinpoint what is going to happen next or what will happen 10 years from now. Just be present today. The reality is one day life will continue on without you. Just like a train. When it is your time, you will get off and that train will continue. And there is no way of stopping that. I think I am starting to understand the scripture that says ""Worry not about your life, for today's worries are enough. And the worrying is not going to help. So I would rather spend time just trusting the one who gives life. I just want to be present.",1
"I recently got diagnosed with GAD and need help with how to cope with potential panic attacks Monday I have a panic attack and was diagnosed with GAD. 

I'm only 18 years old and I do stress and I have had anxiety before but not that I've had a full on panic attack I feel like it's taking over my everyday things.

Last night I had one and this morning when I woke up I almost had one but I managed through it.

So far I've been outside and that helps me but doesn't make it go away fully.

I went to eat at a restaurant and right when I walked it I got panicky and couldn't eat my food because I couldn't hold it down and I had to swallow the 2 bites I did take WITH WATER.

I know this is temporary and I plan to work out and get a therapist and MAYBE take meds but is there anything I can remember to know for next time?

It hasn't been a full week and I've had 2 panic attack and almost another.

I'm anxious about being anxious cause that will trigger a possible attack

Panic attacks make it feel like I'm having a heart attack or anything life threating.

I should enjoy life but ik this is something that will take some time to deal with.

My hands shake a little and I still have a fast heart beat even when I don't feel panicky. It also feels like a pit in my stomach is waiting for a thought to pop up for me to panic.

When waking up today I panicked and walking it off reminded me of Monday when I walking and had the panic attack.

Anything I should know for next time?",2

This morning he hide my meds from me, after an hour I woke him and asked where they were. He cussed me out and told me he not to talk to him until 1pm. Last night, he forced me into our son’s room and as I was trying to escape he slapped my wrist in the door.",3

"Restricting stressors on devices. help! Hi all, I thought this would be a good place to ask.

Sometimes its best for my stress and anxiety to flat out block apps and websites that cause me stress. I have a very bad habit of wanting to dig things up from the past, even if they would hurt me, and often times the best way for me to combat this is to restrict myself from accessing social media.

Right now I've been using an app called 'Freedom' which has been very useful. The issue? I've figured out how to disable it whenever I want. Knowing that at any point I could breach the restrictions I put in place just makes me super anxious. I'm able to go into the VPN settings and turn off 'connect on demand' which allows me to bypass the block.

Does anyone know any surefire way I can block things, and not have access to them? being able to set a block on social media for 24 hours is often the best way I can get back on track with my day, and stop stressing over digging up things that would hurt me. Is self discipline my only option, or is there a better way?",3

And typing it out makes it feel so silly to be this upset like oh, maybe not this round but there are two more rounds that you could get in for. But honestly this was kinda my last straw, I just give up. My friend who said that there was no way she would get in and that we should both go to this other university together got in today and I just feel like I'm not going to get in and I'm going to have to go to that other university and be all alone because everyone I know got in for the really competitive program I was trying for except me and I just can't bring myself to try in school at this point because I will never be good enough because I try so hard and I think I actually understand but I never understand and because I fuck up one question on a stupid test it ruins the rest of my fucking life. I just need to get into this one specific university nothing else matters its just this one. But its never going to happen. Because I was too stupid to not join every club in the school in 9th grade to become the president of them now. Because I never took extra lessons outside of school to learn math. Because I'm just not good enough. I mean I know this one specific university is not the end of the world but it feels like it is. I'm disappointing my family who expect me to get in. I'm disappointing myself because I told myself I would work harder and try harder and cut out all my free time to focus on school but I just didn't do that and now I've ruined my chances. I just don't want to keep trying. I don't even want to go to university. I'm just so tired.",1

 It feels like weekends and holidays are useless. We still do work even in those days (F*cking research Papers). I don't think 1 full day of happiness is even possible at this point.

"Okay, I can't live like this. How do I get help? I've had health anxiety since I can remember, I was like probably 6 or 7 when I had my first flare up but this last year it is off the charts. I actually have had some health scares and I think it's triggering it beyond belief. I think it's actually causing the aches and pains. I'm at the point where I'm 500% sure I have colon cancer and ALS and cervix/ovarian cancer and an undiagnosed heart issue. Now my kidneys hurt? So naturally my cancer has spread. It's been like this for a year, and my only relief has been when seasonal depression hits.

I'm getting married soon. I have a good job. I have lots to look forward to but I'm so so sure I won't be around to see it. I need help and no one takes me seriously. My doctor doesn't understand that this iya ruining my life and keeps giving me meds. With side effects. To someone with health anxiety. I've taken like six different types and none help at all. I can only afford 4 sessions of therapy per year and have found them mostly useless.

There has to be something. I can do. I'm so sure I'm going to die and I'm fucking terrified.",2

"Moved away to be married, why can't I be happy? I'm supposed to be happy Trigger warnings btw

Hi, idk if this is in the right place but I just need to get stuff out.
I (24f) should be so happy an excited, I'm getting married next week. I love my Fiance, and I want to marry him. 
But I've had to move hundreds of miles away from my mum and my friends. 
I have BPD and probably autism, but NHS won't help me get diagnosis for either.

I haven't been working and been living with my parents becase of depression. Now because me and husband can barely afford a basic place to live I will have to work. And I want to. I want to be so capable and successful and hard working but I just want to kms anytime I think of getting up and going out.

I've only been living in my new town a week, and everytime i remember im not going home i feel so depressed. 

All my Fiance can say is he's sorry. But that doesn't fix anything or help me or comfort me at all, and my BPD shuts any suggestions he has down because substitues wont help. I don't know anyone here,   and everyone in my community is old. And whilst yes old people can make lovely friends, It's not the same.

I can't drive, afford to drive or have the mental stability to drive so I feel so lonely and depressed.

And I feel so awful for my fiance when I'm literally saying I'm depressed and I don't want to be here. 

I just want to be hit by a car or something, every day my brain says stuff like that and I'm so tired of holding it together.

I don't want to be here. And yet as always I'll carry on. I'll just ""cope"". I won't kms. But it hurts all the same.",1

"I am going to start out by saying I am depressed and anxious but my depression feels like nothing when compared to those around me. Both of my parents are currently going through cancer scares. My dad has had cancer removed from his lungs many times and is extremely depressed, lays in bed all day every day except when there is a family function, which he goes to but barely participates in conversation. Unfortunately, my brother is the worst of all. He lives on his own about 45 minutes away and I guess my family was not paying close enough attention this past 6 months. He would come to family gatherings and act happy and we would always ask how things were at his house and we were always told fine, the last we saw him was Christmas. In February, he cut my entire family off, will not speak to any of us and says we never once cared about him. Many of my family members go to his house and try to get him to talk to us but he will not come to the door and we are told to go away. We called the police, we were told he is not a threat and they could not do anything. We called the mental health hotline and they sent someone who said he came to the door, they said your family is concerned about you and he said no they are not. They mentioned he does not look healthy and very pale. Our mom tried to go into the house as she has a key and he shoved her out. Lastly, we told a neighbor that used to work with him about the issue and he went into the house from the back. He told us my brother admitted he has not been to work in 2 months and there is dog feces and beer cans everywhere in the house. This situation is causing my depression and anxiety to spiral, it is all I think about but I am trying to be strong for my parents, my mom is having major surgery this week.I do not know where to turn to. I am sorry if this is all over the place, I am lost. My entire family is depressed",1

"Just turned 22, you.S male.So I have really bad c-PTSD. Tons of bullying by male peers and teachers, physical abuse at school and serious bloody batterings at home, psychological abuse, bad relationship between parents that cultivated in an absent father and a drug-addicted mother that either overdosed or killed herself in front of me naked, sexually, physically and mentally abusive 4-year relationship with an older girl, workplace bullying, sexual harassment at concerts, abusive HS principal (suspended me constantly for no reason, dragged me out of class etc.), social ostracization, etc.there is all that, but last year I was $exually assaulted by a friend of 10 years. Afterwards I tried to engage in a playfight because she was angry drunk and no one asked if I was ok and I wanted to lighten the mood. One of her defenders said ""she beat the shit out of you"" verbatim. She punched me in the face like 5 times, left a ton of huge bruises and sprained my elbow. it is on film. After that happened, I blacked out on alcohol for the first time ever. Afterwards I received serious abuse and harassment. People I did not even know were messaging me calling me a psychopath, a liar, someone told me ""if you keep falsely accusing her you will end up in jail and actually get $exually assaulted"" after implying I drove my mother to suicide. it is been going on for a year now, the girl also falsely accused me of r@pe to get out of the situation. Her friends and my at the time friends were sick people. she is popular and clearly I am a doormat and the abuse and gaslighting and event itself just made me lose my fucking marbles for about a year straight and I was in a constant paranoid drunken state. I guess this was just the tipping point for me. I could not handle it and I just lost it and never slept or cleaned my room and quit my job and attempted $uicide.How do I get out of this place?

"A lot of the time, my depression just feels like a weight on my chest, always slowing me down, always holding me back. Always stopping me right before I get started.

I just want to be able to handle situations like everyone else. I just want to be able to use my emotional and physical energy without having to worry about feeling drained from it immediately.it is like, I cannot even THINK about my future without getting this unbearable wave of dread and guilt and exhaustion. All I can say to myself is ""I do not want to do this anymore"" because everything is just too much. I am not cut out for this world and I cannot keep fighting like this forever. it is so fucking hard. Everything is so fucking hard. Every morning, when I wake up from my dreams, it feels like I am stepping back into the real nightmare. I cannot keep doing this every single fucking day for the rest of my life.I just want to fuck off into the woods or something.

"Health Anxiety? Random abdominal pain, scared of going to the doctor and potentially hearing worst case scenario I’ve had a LOT going on since Christmas. I lost my grandmother to cancer, I’ve been sick, had a panic attack, felt grief out of nowhere for the first time which included pains, random anxiety, and somewhat a fear of my own health. 

I had diverticulitis at the end of October last year and it was the first time I realized “oh wow. I’m not invincible and there are more things than stomach aches”

With all of this going on, I’ve also now started to feel a small pain around my gallbladder. It mainly happens when I’m readjusting my position, sitting uncomfortably, etc. it feels almost swollen and like I’m squishing it (I’m a bigger guy). I’ve read things online for relief hoping it was just gas or it’d go away on its own. It’s definitely gotten better! When it’s not hurting I’d feel a pain in my lower right, or on my left side. All of these pains are a 0-3 max on the pain scale. 

I can’t decide if I’m just looking for something wrong, or if I’m having health anxiety. I’m just so scared to go to the doctor because I don’t think I’ve ever gone and heard good news. It feels like it’s getting better over time, but I wonder if I’m over analyzing every pain or feeling I feel now.

I know I should go to the doctor, but I’m scared of going and hearing I have to have surgery, or if I’d hear (hopefully) “it’s just irritated from a bad diet and lack of exercise. Lay off fatty foods and take 2 of these a day and you’ll be all good”",2

"Monday through Friday I am fine. I have some hard days but for the most part, I do ok. Then the weekend comes and it is awful. I realize how lonely I really am. I realize how I have absolutely no one. I try to stay active, but I am just doing everything by myself. I try to invite people to do things but they already have plans. I have tried to go places to meet new people but I end up in places with absolutely no way to meet new people.I wanted a family, I wanted the warmth that comes with it. I loved having someone to love and care for. But I think if this is my default I would rather be alone. Maybe it is greedy of me to want someone in my life because it holds off the loneliness. If I cannot be happy alone doing everything on my own then maybe I do not deserve a partner or a family. I have talked to people and have dated but even that makes me feel lonely. Its not having people, I am just like this. I just do not feel like I belong in this world. I do not feel like there is a place for me here. I live in a big city and I cannot seem to find a place for me.

I have barely been able to take care of tasks that need to be done. I just feel like I am existing. I am sure at some point this feeling will go away for a few weeks but then it will come back again.

I can find a million reasons to be thankful for who she is and her being in my life, but now after being there that night I did not sleep at all I basically laid there wide awake with my eyes closed unable to sleep because my mind was racing too much to get comfortable It breaks my heart but at the same time I do what I have to to help my self survive, I am not going to be someone is fucking toy, I am human and I am legit tired of the BS.. thank god I see my counselor today because Id probably do something stupid if I was not Little update",1

Every. Single. Day. When I get home there's an issue. It is always my older sister 100%.

Let alone assault you for no reason. May God forgive your ignorant soul for thinking you can be in the same building as her when she feels like throwing a temper tantrum like a 4 year old. 

I've talked to our mom numerous times about her. She defends her every single time, sometimes I'll tell her she needs to stop enabling her and she just responds by enabling her. 

They're always telling me to pack my shit and go. Believe me, I'd fucking love to. But even though I pay rent you know they're always holding it over my head what a parasite I am and I'd be dead/homeless without them.",3

"Terrified about continuing to go to a chiropractor I've had neck pain and stiffness for months and after an MRI and EMG found nothing like herniated discs or tumors, I tried PT and only got worse with periodic lightheadness and nausea.

I'm so desperate for relief that I started going to a chiropractor, which I've always been skeptical of as a profession. The chiropractor said x-rays show my spine is very rigid and doesn't bend like it should when I look straight up, so he thinks my cervical joints are the problem.  

My neck feels worse two days later after he used a ""chiropractic activator"" on my cervical spine (no twisting or cracking, it's a kinetic energy thing that looks like a glue gun). I'm terrified of getting a dissection of the arteries in my neck and having a stroke. But the medical literature shows that cervical dissections are rare, and my family and friends who have had benefits from chiros are encouraging me to see through a few more sessions.",2

"Hi All, I have battled depression for a long time(as an adult) and as a child was diagnosed with ADHD and have been on every kind of medicine to help me focus you can possibly think of. I was in denial about my depression for a long time but one day sought help and finally started medication and seeing a psychiatrist for it in 2015. I have been on Wellbutrin every since and frankly that alone saved my life. I also take Concerta as needed during the work week to help me focus and have been on that forever. Over the years I have experienced depression slumps where it was like the Wellbutrin was not working as well and was experiencing more frequent anxiety attacks and was put on lexapro with wellbutrin. I was on that combo for about 2 years and noticed i lost all interest in everything I used to love before. It was nice to not feel anxious but it was not nice to not feel anything else. Back to just wellbutrin and also back to experiencing panic attacks and daily spiraling thoughts and questions that I could not answer about why and how could I still be depressed? I workout, eat healthy, have a loving family, have friends, love my job, graduated college and yet still feel as if I have an anchor pulling me down physically, emotionally and mentally. After many talks with my doctor I am now on Prozac and Wellbutrin and had found a great balance and felt almost normal for a long time up until recently. I come to reddit to share my story and see who else out there has experienced my sort of symptoms and what you have tried to combat these slumps? What are your experiences with other medications that you have been prescribed? Any help or guidance is greatly appreciated! Another Depression Slump",1

"When I was 15, my family sent me off to a treatment center after a few runs away, an overdose and two attempts at my life. I did really bad in the program but there was one therapist who really really helped me a lot we will call her P. I originally had a therapist that my parents requested because he had the same religion as my parents but he was not helpful. About 4 months in to my program, I got in some legal trouble and that therapist threw up their hands and went to the board to have me removed from the program. P freaked out in the board meeting and told everyone that giving up on people who need help is not what this program is about so she made room for me on her plate and the board let me stay in the program. I saw her nearly every day and wed talk about everything. She knew me way better than I could know myself. If I did not graduate the program, I would be put in a higher security treatment program or to juvenile hall. She was always my advocate and she made sure that I graduated even when my parents ran out of the money they got from the second mortgage they took out to pay for my program. Right after I graduated from the program, I found her on facebook and we chatted from time to time until it eventually stopped for no reason. I eventually stopped using my facebook but I kept it because that was the only way I could get ahold of her. It is now 15 years after I entered the program. I just turned 30. I own a successful business, own a house and have been married to the love of my life for 5 years. I have been spiraling deeper and deeper into depression for the last three years. I have no reason to be but it has been happening. I have been to psychologists and counselors, I have been on medications, I have tried to talk to my spouse but that is a story for another post. Nothing has been working and my thoughts are darkening to the point that I fear the worst for myself at my own hand. I keep thinking about the days when I could just go into Ps office and talk to her or see her walking the halls and ask for a chat. Last I heard, she moved to a different program and eventually retired in Colorado with her husband. She probably barely remembers who I am because there were 50 kids in the program at any given time being seen by 4 counselors, the average program lasted 8 monthsso that is a lot of faces going in and out of there. I am wondering if anyone thinks it would be strange for me to reach out to the only therapist that worked for me 15 years later? The only therapist that helped me",1

"I really want to get help. I want to confide in someone, but I am too hung up on the thought that they would take on my issues as well. I have always had the mindset that issues are personal; something that you deal with alone. You could tell me that is not true, but I just subconsciously act fake in front of people. I mask my feelings without even noticing that I am doing it. My last therapist did not work for me because I was not even being real with her. I would keep smiling and I would get extremely uncomfortable when opening up, so I would barely say anything about myself or my problems. I only realize this looking back on it now. Hell, we even talked about the weather for a whole session once. I know that its horrible but I do not know how to stop. After a recent breakdown, I realized that I do this with everyone I know. Even with my closest friends and family. So I am basically isolating myself without even trying. How fucking crazy is that? Depression is weird, man. Stuck",1

Three weeks ago, I started up a new job with security, I got one 6 hour shift, and three 12 hour shifts. Honestly, I love this job despite the hours, and I can handle it. 

But, this past week? Everything feels like it fell apart. My sister popped over with her husband on a surprise visit ( haven't seen her in 14 years ) so it should've been exciting, but all it did was bring trouble to our already fragile household. She instigated drama with my father and everyone else, then her boyfriend was just causing problems with zero consequences. Then, two days later, my Uncle shows up and it's all great.. up until he hits me with news tonight that he's got cancer and he's trying to enjoy himself since he's scared of worse case scenario. All of this on top of family dilemmas with my father, seeing it affect my grandmother? ALL tied together with the very awkward sleep I get, I can just feel my mental health regressing back to incredibly old, toxic, unhealthy ways. I wanna smoke weed to ignore the stress and call off work, but I know doing all that will ruin any progress I've ever made.

Ex took half my assets and I am sure was putting a lot extra away for years.It is ridiculously hard. I have a product as good as anything in the market and comparable to other products raising 10's of millions of dollars. But I cannot get it out there, nothing I do works enough. I now have a product that probably requires a team of developers and I am maintaining it all myself and trying to grow the business.I am just so tired, burnt out and depressed I cannot do the things I need to do to make this work anymore and I feel I am going to lose everything.The only thing keeping me going is the thought that I have the product and the hope that one day I will get noticed or will be able to get my marketing sorted and get in front of the right customers.I feel I am going backwards and everyone I know seems to be going forward on easy mode. Home are going up in value (we sold our beautiful big house in the divorce and now renting), well paying jobs with minimal effort (IT).I just spent my entire weekend working and doubt it will make a dent while other people are enjoying their lives.I will never find a partner again as I am financially ruining myself.I just want to end it all but my 10 year old daughter still needs me. It would devastate her if I was gone. For the last few years I have just been thinking try to last as long as you can until she does not need you as much (maybe 16). I am not living for any future now, I do not look forward to anything. Every day I wake up and say to myself 'I want to die'.She is still full of hope and tells me about her dream house and dream bedroom etc and says things like ""daddy when your website gets better do you think we could get a new house etc"". Once we had the best house of her friends and now are just renting and they are all buying new homes.I look at her now and love her so much. But wish she had a better dad as I feel I am spiralling down. The hardest part is I know I could have given her so much more.I called a support line on friday and am going to a doctor today to get some help.At the core I think the main problem is I hate myself, do not value myself and probably do not feel like I deserve love or success and that derails everything I do.Sorry if this has been rambling.

"Scared to exercise I’ve had health anxiety for around 5 years now and it was based around a fear of cancer after a scare I had in 2014, but in during a run in February I had a pretty bad panic attack that I mistook for a heart attack/cardiac arrest which really shit me up and I’ve been terrified of any heart related problems since. I used to love running/working out and would exercise 5/6 times a week, but since the panic attack I’ve been scared to go for a run or do any strenuous exercises in the gym such as deadlifts. If I do exercise, I spend the entire time terrified something might happen to me and it has just ruined something I used to really enjoy. Does anyone’s health anxiety stop them from enjoying or even doing any exercise?",2

"I worry if I am on it for like a year or more I will start getting sexual disfunction and stuff, I am only 16 so I really do not want this. I have been on 8mg citalopram for 4 days now and have experienced no real side effects, just maybe drowsiness and nausea but the nausea is super mild and idk if the drowsiness is really even from the meds because I have always kind of felt a lil drowsy. its not affected my sex drive at all, and i really pray and hope it does not, because I am only 16 as i said. i do not want it to ruin anything for me. if i go up to 16mg do you think it will? I am going up in only 3 days to 16mg. I am excited because I have noticed benefits with it already, like getting rid of my morning tremors that have affected me for like over a year now. everything else could possibly be a placebo... like how i feel like I am better in the morning. normally id be super angry and just tense but i have not felt tense at all really. like mentally.i only plan to be on them for maybe 6 months at most, i just worry about long term side effects, and it seems like everyone has story about it affecting their sex drive. thank God mine is still fine. but its a little weird how everyone experiences a lot of side effects the first week and i feel almost nothing... is something wrong? is it not working for me? idk. the anxiety and depression have not went away though, just a lil better on depression. i hope to see major progress though soon, and I am going to go to therapy and cbt and hopefully with help from that i can come off them and be recovered or something. but yeah, what do you guys think? how long should i stay on them to not get long term stuff? thank you. How long should I stay on antidepressants?",1

"I am in the worst place mentally that I have ever been in since I was first diagnosed with depression 6 years ago. I have no motivation to do anything anymore. I have a job and I work around 25-35 hours per week, but it takes up all of the energy I can possibly give, and when I am not working I just sit at home and do nothing most of the time. I do not even enjoy watching tv or movies anymore. I have no motivation or energy to hang out with friends or family and I always end up cancelling plans. This is absolutely destroying all of my relationships and I hate it so much. The most basic tasks like brushing my teeth or showering feel impossible a lot of the time.

"A method I use to reduce my health anxiety Hiv

Gonorrhea

Chlymedia

Mouth cancer

Bacterial infection

Stomach cancer

Throat cancer

Herpes

Going blind

Going deaf

Intestinal parasites

IBS

Heart defect

Lung cancer

In no particular order all of these have been individual cases of my health anxiety since April last year where I have genuinely believed without a shadow of a doubt I have got and began to process the self diagnosis as the truth and you know what...
NOT A SINGLE FUCKING ONE OF THEM HAS BEEN CORRECT!!!!!!!

Now I look at this list everytime I begin to self diagnose again. Not googling symptoms has also had a massive improvement.
I've also noticed that it is when I have a lot of downtime that I get my health anxiety back and it is virtually non existent when I'm super busy as my brain has something to focus on.

I got mad and said if u don't wanna be friends anymore then that's fine goodbye. I really wish I didn't say that cuz then she blocked me on insta, snap, and twitter, and even my number. I reached out to another friend to ask her why she did that. the response I got was that my friend just wants to be left alone. Idk if that means she doesn't wanna talk to me anymore or if she just wants to have a lil space for a while idk? what makes me more anxious is that we both work at the same place and that's how we meet and became close friends. before all this, she really liked talking to me and she thought of me as like a best friend that she's known for years even tho we only known each other for like 2 years now, and she really gets my humor and I think of her as like a big sister figure to me, she always askes me if im feeling down when i am. I tried reaching out to my other friends to help calm me down and try my best to forget about what happened but nothing worked. My friends and other people just say people come and go but it doesn't help or work. I just want my friend back and I wanna talk to her again before all of this happened. I don't even know",3

"We are not looking for your daily quotes and inspirations, no offense, but most of us do not even have the energy to be happy. It sounds happy on the surface but it is not going to fix what the depressed person is going through. Instead, actively listen to what they are trying to say, most of them do not want just anybody to fix their problems, they just need somebody to listen and to understand. Things are not just going to magically disappear the next day. People who have never been depressed before do not really understand how tiring it is just to get out of bed and even remotely try to enjoy life. I feel these responses are lazy and do not give enough attention to the actual person but sweeping them under the rug. ""Go for a walk, enjoy life, be happy"" are all the wrong things to say to a depressed person",1
"I'm mad and sulking over a single bad date. I'm 28. Had 6 dates in my life. Never had sex before. Had 1 bad acquaintance that I needed therapy to deal with.

I don't hate women. I don't think everything is pointless. I chat with coworkers, but I don't have a lot of friends. Ladies seem to think I'm a nice person and funny. I don't have much trouble shamelessly asking someone out. I've long thought I have enough hobbies and interests and goals to keep myself mentally stable and preoccupied. Doesn't stop everyone from saying I'm a sweet guy who just needs to be more confident, less sensitive, and wait for the right person.

I get flustered when I meet someone flirty or shameless, but I play it off with self-deprecation and wit.

I had a date with a coworker who was coming onto me frequently  (poking me, prodding me, talking about bodily functions, giving me looks and signs and thank yous, took my phone number, called me, wishes me morning, acts like she's out of breath around me, talks about and asks me sexual questions, talks about her dating history, etc).

She wanted to go to a Barne's and Noble's. I was 10 minutes late due to traffic and she'd shown up an hour early to give herself a headstart.

She stood next to me, I comically volunteered to be pack mule, and we sat and read books for a while, talking in-between. She made a spa appointment at 4pm. I asked her what she wanted - 1) friendship, 2) casual sex, 3) a relationship. I wasn't good for 2 (no confidence).

She described to me frequently about how much her previous relationships messed her up, we talked indirectly our thoughts about romance and such.

Her answer was 1 and she said she didn't know what the future hold.

We left and I went to a Chic-filet she'd informed me was there. Then I drove home rather than wait the hour for her appointment to finish, said I had fun, and drove home listening to Drowning Pool and Foo Fighters.

I got home, played a video game, laid down, and fought back tears feeling every insecure and negative thought I've had about myself. This date was something I wanted and it felt like I came away with less than I started with. She said she'd text me later and didn't get around to it until much later, and even though it was a short time I felt myself getting lonelier and madder because we just weren't having the initial flirty back and forth we did before the date.

I turned my phone off.

Everyone is going to tell me ""there's a million fish"" and she even said ""some people just don't vibe"" but the messages are just so unclear to me right now. This isn't too long after I broke up with someone who I felt like I did vibe with.

I just can't see myself continuing to give this much energy toward meeting someone new another 5-00 times like everybody else. I'm a sensitive person. I feel drained and hateful of everyone that dating comes so easily to even though I know that's wrong. I'm so mad we didn't click its embarassing, and I know it's not her fault. I don't know what's wrong with me and I don't feel like exercising or doing anything positive. I just want to be angry.

I guess I walked in expecting she'd throw herself at me, and I'd have the chance to be a gentleman and be like ""hey I like you, but I want to get to know you"" and she'd be like ""ah he's not just a desperate fuck, he has character."" And well that didn't happen. Instead I feel like I got read and told politely I wasn't what someone was looking for. And any attempt at friendship on my end will be a desperate act.

I could be entirely wrong. 

I would have liked if we'd hugged at the end or made additional plans. She agreed to doing something in the near future but I didn't get any excitement out of it. Optimistically I want to say we could probably be friends. Cynically I think she's not going to reach out and I spent an hour each way driving, took a day off of work for what I wanted to be a great date - I did all of that for nothing.

Of the 3 actual dates I've gone on after many years of rejection and indifference - the first didn't know how to tell me she wasn't interested and ghosted me for weeks, the second said sweet things about me but said she wasn't ready and was still healing from a previous relationship and said I need to be with someone who can do 50-50 in the relationship, and now this, where I felt someone coming onto me and tried to match it, and realizing at the end that I walked away in a toxic cloud of mental fog.

I hate dating. So much. And I hate the way my brain and my emotions work. So much.",3

"How I am *almost* over my Health Anxiety Quick intro:
3 years a go I had an incident in the shower that mimicked a stroke. I came out of it unharmed but it messed me up psychologically. Ever since then my body takes any feeling it gets and goes into panic mode. Now i hate driving, i hate taking a shower, i hate exercising. You name it, if i makes me hot, i get anxious. At onc point i was so anxious showering i had to sit down and hold on for dear life the entire time i was in there.

Now i'm about 80% over it. and form my experience the only way over it - is to go through it. And what i mean by that is you need to face this demon head on. I know its the last thing you want to hear but trust me. If you never face it you will be running forever.

However it will take time for your brain to rewrite its default path ways. So at the moment the default behavior is fear, and to curl up and say please dont hurt me. So your brain interprets it as a threat and will spiral out of control causing all sorts of symptoms the worst of which being a panic attack.

Now next time you start getting the fear coming on try this instead. Say to your fear out loud ""Just kill me then"" ""Bring it on"" ""Lets see what you can do"" and taunt your fear and let what ever you think is going to happen happen. by wanting the what ever it is you are afraid of to happen will make the fear vanish.

Another thing to think. If you were to say have a heart attack it would just happen... whether you worried or not. Worrying isnt going to some how miraculously save you.

At my lowest - the turning point for me was when i just thought i'd rather be dead than to feel like this anymore. and from then on i basically laid down my life to my fear and said just kill me. Kill me now or shut the fuck up. I needed to hit rock bottom so I could rebuild my brain the right way. and for a few weeks i just kept saying ""Kill me now or shut up"" over and over until my brain started using the new default behavior. 

It can take months to retrain your brain and then add years on that to fully forget. but this is what is working for me.

TLDR: Taunt your fear. egg it on. call it out. ask it to do its worst even if it kills you. Let it flow through you and out the other side I bet nothing bad happens

TLDR 2: If you were going to die it would just happen... whether you worried or not. Worry isnt going to some how miraculously save you",2

"I really do not have a bad life outside of finances. I have a great husband and kids and cat and I enjoy doing things like art, watching horror movies and making food. However I hate always have to worry about money. I just got a job and it pays well but I just feel like its never enough. I feel that Ill never be able to buy a home that is mine, have a savings for emergencies like medical or the vet or a car breakdown and it makes me super depressed, anxious and angry. I hate having angry outbursts because I am worried about money. We do not spend money on things for ourselves (my husband and I) and on the rare occasion we do its like a take out dinner or something.I just hate how expensive everything is in this country and how when you are poor people believe you do not deserve to treat yourself ever, have pets and kids and that you did it to yourself. we have worked since before we were legally able to and have tried to give our kids a good life. They have not wanted for anything really as far as food, shelter, clothes, books and even toys. I just want to be comfortable though so I know I never have to worry about money. I do not want to have crazy expensive cars and bags and all that but a safe home, new clean furniture that is not old and scratched and a new reliable car. And it just depresses me so much that as hard as we try it just is a perpetual state of worry over money. Life is to short yet to be worry about money all the time but I just cannot help it. Its on my mind constantly and it makes me unable to eat. I fear checking the bank account after bills come out and I hate getting the mail everyday because I am always worried that its going to be some crazy bill I did not know about and bad news. Usually I am a hopeful person but my depression and anxiety has gotten way worse over the past few years. I did not have the best start in life like my peers in the area I lived in. They all have parents that put them through college, gave them money to start businesses or buy houses and I feel like a loser because I have had to do it all myself and my husbands story is the same. I always feel people look down on me because I am poor but I try so hard. I wish I could just get a little money to give myself a head start but I know that is not going to happen and I am just super depressed that I am stuck in this cycle that I cannot control. cannot go back to school for nursing like my dream because I have to work. I do not know how to pull myself out of these problems and this depression because I feel like there is now way out. I feel I would not be so bad off if I had money to live",1

Obvious throwaway. I have just lived life just I do not know just living so that my little sister does not lose her older sibling. I had a family once. Two families united. It was not perfect but it was a family. My grandmother always hated me she would tell me that I was useless at the age of 8 and that i would grow up to be a fat and useless slob that would attain nothing in life. My father well he never really cared for me he would let his mother talk about me and say all of this to me. I am now known as the recluse of the family who is a failure. My father believes in many superstitious stuff. My parents were going to divorce when I was 13 it shattered my whole reality. I lost vision of what family even was. That was the day that i lost both sides of my family. My father brainwashed me by suggesting certain ideas to the point that i could envision them in my mind. He used me to get back with my mother. I ruined my mother and my sisters life for being weak. Years pass family still broken. Have been diagnosed with severe depression. Dad talks ill about my mother and accuses her of adultery with women. I try to defend her he believes nothing but the superstitious beliefs and advice that his family and peers offer. I have done nothing yet I have been beat physically and mentally. I am not even loving for myself. I do not know what to do anymore. I have always wanted to die since I was a child but I have held on long enough for my little sister. I cannot keep doing this. My mind is breaking. I feel myself slipping away. No one wanted me in this world not even my own family. My own father my own grandmother and the paternal side of the family. I was the oldest grandchild but i was always belittled so that the smaller boy could be seen as the prodigy. I was nothing. I am dirt. I am trash. I want to die I am so weak. My sister has tried to make me feel better for what I have attained in life. I did not attain it because I wanted to I only did it because it was expected of me. I do not know what I am doing with my life. I can envision no future. I am broken. No person will want me as their partner. I want to die. I need to die maybe that way i can free my family of the shackles of a useless parasite as my dad called me. I can tell my own mother dislikes me too deep down. Why would not she it is my fault my father is still in our life. He broke her too. She is beyond repair. I have doomed us all. Both sides of the family hate each other. Death threats have happened attempts at murder have happened. I do not think i deserve to live. Autism and severe depression are nothing but a joke in my father's and mother's eyes. I am meant to be normal like everyone else who is able to live life headstrong. I cannot take this anymore. I have never had anyone and i never will. So many thoughts so much i want to say nothing comes out. No one really cares. it is all a facade. Deep down we are all selfish. it is okay the weak like me are not meant to survive. I am weak. I am nothing. For anyone willing to read.,1

"My feelings arent making sense anymore TLDR at bottom Ive been struggling with depression and anxiety for a good 10 years now, with the worst dip taking place a year back. Im slowly starting to get better but lately something weird has started happening. 

The worst part of depression for me is the sadness that I cant seem to shake. It’s not the normal kind of sadness, rather the romantic/heartbroken sadness. 
I’ve not been in a relationship for a long time, and I’m not well enough to be in a relationship at the time. 
I still talk to girls like I used to, but in a much more restricted way.
One person recently wrote to me and we started talking (nothing intense or anything).
When that person doesnt answer or say something I could interpret as something negative through mental parkour,
My heart breaks, I get the biggest pit in my stomach and I get completely engulfed in the sorrow. 
This happened the very first day of us talking. 
I am not in love with this person, we dont really know eachother, nothing has happened, i dont even know if what we’re doing has any romantic side to it at all.

Most of the time I can understand why I feel the way I do, even if it’s mostly negative. But this anxiety-ridden pit in my stomach wont go away, and I cant reason with it.

So I guess the TLDR; 
I become unreasonably romantically attatched, after just a few words over text, which leads me to feel constantly heartbroken. 

Am I just lonely and I havnt realized it?",1

"Absolutely terrified of having autism. Does anyone have fears of mental illness/ developmental delay? This would honestly be funny if it didn’t scare me so badly. I don’t really even know why it scares me this much, and I feel bad because autism isn’t strictly a negative. It’s just a different wiring of the brain that emphasizes different skills. It’s dumb, but I can’t help it. 

Last night I had a nightmare that I was actually autistic and that no one had ever told me so that I could live a more normal life. The whole thing shattered my perspective of myself in a way that was profoundly uncomfortable and was kind of from a third person view although I felt everything very intensely. I looked quite different, but the thing that freaks me out is that what if I actually do look like that and just have a very limited outside perspective of myself. I also saw a bunch of ways that maybe certain interactions I thought were normal may only have felt alright because I’m actually autistic. 

This all would just be a weird one off dream if I hadn’t been terrified of being autistic for a long period last summer. I would spend every break possible at my summer internship taking diagnostic tests to prove to myself that I don’t have it. I was an anxious mess.

Since then, I’ve had a number of fears about having different mental illnesses (everything from schizophrenia to NPD to bipolar) and don’t know quite what to do about it. I think I have ocd, but I haven’t been able to go to therapy. 

Has anyone else had hypochondria about these specific themes? What strategies help you?

Edit: I also know that I don’t have any of the symptoms, but I can’t help be afraid any way. ",2
"&amp;#x200B;I am a 26 year old exhibiting clear signs of Parkinsons. Every day, I feel my cognition along with my ability to concentrate decline. I have bouts of dizziness and am struggle to keep up with work. I am not half the person I was just a couple years ago and I know I will soon reach the point where I am unable to work. It is only a matter of time till my declining cognition will expose me at work and that may lead me to getting fired. I do not think I have it in me to get another job. I am not the same person that was originally hired.Cognition is only half the picture. I have increasing stiffness in my legs and it is inevitable that I will get to a point where I will struggle to walk. I do not really know what I have to look forward to. Sure, I work my butt off to get enough money to survive but what happens next ? A life of struggling to do the most basic things ? Become a burden to my parents/family ? I t is morally wrong for me to get married, have children knowing that I have this condition. I cannot fathom put such a large burden on anybody. These are thing that I have I always looked forward to and it hurts me deeply that I will never obtain these.I am basically a zombie amongst the living. I just eat like a pig, try to set myself up to survive, do not really care about much, and just try to enjoy my limited time with loved ones. But living in the moment is not easy with the lingering disease. I am not suicidal as I would not be able to do something like that to my family. As long as I have an obligation to my family, I will always be around, try to be there for them, and enjoy my time with them.I would not wish this horrible fate on anybody where everything someone does is pointless. That brings me to my original question. How do I cope with having no future ? How to cope with having no future ?",1

"Hi everyone - I have been depressed for a long time and my dental hygiene is always the first to go. My brushing frequency was reduced to maybe 1x every week or two. Every time I brush my teeth my gums bleed. I looked closely the other day and saw some plaque buildup and a cavity in a wisdom tooth that grew in sideways. Gross, I know! Its really embarrassing and I am starting to get really anxious about my teeth all falling out so I am making an effort to brush my teeth more often and I got a Groupon to see a dentist for an exam, cleaning, and X-rays. I am seeing them on Thursday. I am wondering how I should communicate to the dentist that I know my teeth are in poor shape due to depression? Is that something they are familiar with? I know I am not obligated to explain myself but I would feel better if I could. And if anyone has suggestions for restoring your teeth after neglect that would also be much appreciated!

"Constant abdominal pain. Hey all, 

Spent all day in the ER for abdominal pain that I've been having for weeks now. They ended up telling me that it's nothing requiring immediate surgery so I'm good to go.

I have read so much material... listened to so many podcasts and youtube videos, taken meds, gone to counseling... but I still had to write my own book.I had to do my own experiments to see what worked for me. I wrote what worked for me down... and then.. when I went through some difficult times..

I am surrounded by people. People are fucking everywhere. I have lots of friends and possibilities to do just ""something"" are endless, but they all seem meaningless. I know what I live for, but when I cannot make any progress and any and all entertainment seems pointless, I just do not know what to live for. The feeling in itself is meaningless, because I know there is no intrinsic meaning to be found, so why is it there? I know it is triggered by boredom and loneliness, but only two days ago I was with my family the whole day. I did not speak to anyone yesterday or today, but I do not feel like that is very long at all. I should be able to entertain myself but how..... Life seems meaningless",1

I'm currently at home in the tub trying to calm down, the movie was awesome though! 10/10 would recommend!",2

"So I have been building up depressed feelings over the past year. By now I am at the point where I just do not see the point in life on this earth anymore. I do not like myself, my social life is a flop, I have too much anxiety to study and I do not feel like I have a future (apart from how fucked up this world is in general). I sometimes to about this with my partner and I express not wanting to wake up or just die and I will ask the question ""Why would I keep going?"". His answer then is ""Well because existing is better than not existing"". But I am wondering... Is that even true? Is it really better to exist for a full life, where at the end of the balance you felt like shit 80-90% of the time? is not it then better to not exist at all?I was wondering what you guys think about this from a philosophical point of view? Is existing better than not existing?",1
"15 year old, Sophomore suffering from Health Anxiety ever since I was in elementary school. It's been inherently worse ever since I tried marijuana last summer. Haven't tried no other drugs since but still. It was a bad trip, i had wayy too much.

Current fears that have come and gone:

-Heart Attack
-Heart arrhythmia
-Cancer (Brain)
-ALS or some motor-neuron disease

My current goals are to gain more muscle and be overall more athletic. I want to get rid of my fat and gain muscle. And consequently after sitting in front of a screen for pretty much all of my life i have gained little to no muscle and am extremely weak. So for the past year i started with going for runs around my block and lifting small weights. Then when I got better I jogged for longer periods of time and got a bench press and heavier weights. So I have been lifting weights 6x a week and doing some cardio here and there. I hope i'm not overtraining. but now that my resting heart rate has dramatically decreased (went from 70-80bpm to now about 40-50bpm while resting) 

Scary shit. i don't want it to lower anymore... I'm scared it will just stop while i'm asleep cause it will go too slow and i will die. Irrational? Probably. Impossible? No. That's why all of us worry about this! All the diseases we can get, and death... don't get me started on that. Doesn't help I'm an athiest and have severe DPDR.


God, The story of a boy who lived a sedentary lifestyle up until he was in Grade 9 and then overexercised and killed himself in the process. WTF. I don't want that to be my life story FFS. Just scared. The hospital nearest to me has a bad reputation and houses many drug addicts and is overall filled with sketchy patients so i wouldn't exactly feel safe there. But I'm hanging in there. It's late where i am, school tomorrow. Took 0.5mg Lorazepam about an hour ago. I hope i'll live to see tomorrow ;(",2

I was about to graduate in the coming week with my PhD. I have been suffering through depression for past 2 years now and one year back my then gf of 5 years left me stating this is not what she signed up for.I am at the end of my funding and I cannot afford to pay for another semester. I deserve this because I could not fight through my depression and now its my time to pay my dues. I wasted time and resources trying to get my head straight but what I should have focused on is my PhD. Being an international student in US its difficult to extend my student status with enough financial backing.I just wanted to post and share it because I have been trying to keep all this inside and its been suffocating me.

"I am finding it really difficult to find both motivation and any sense of self-worth. I have been on furlough for over a year now, am in-between jobs, been through a difficult break-up that ended badly, at home I am often belittled by my mom (not always) and my cat is very ill. I am grateful for what I have, I know these issues are not at all unbearable for most, but I guess I am just weaker. I have barely any friends (none in my area) and the few friends that I do have are too busy for me, so I installed Bumble BFF and reinstalled Instagram to try to meet new people. It feels a bit pathetic only having one post on Instagram when everyone has dozens and I am alone in the photos as well. I have been trying to make friends where I live for the past 8 years and nothing. *I feel like I sound like a very irritating and miserable child but I really do not mean to, I am sorry.* I also used to go jogging but it is been too warm so I stopped. I also used to work out at home, but I do not feel comfortable at home most times. Asides from that, nothing really brings much sense of worth from me, I like singing but am not at all great at it, the same goes on with the rest of my hobbies. I bought this volleyball so that I and the person I was seeing could go play at some point in the park, but we never got to, and now it is deflated and always in the way.&amp;#x200B; Today I took a big (for me) step and played some dance games for a little bit and that helped pass the time as well as do a little bit of cardio.

I cannot eat, I can barely sleep, I literally just do everything I can to distract myself and try to pass the time. I have been heading off to bed at 9pm because there is simply nothing to do, there is no one to talk to, no messages, if I send any I would be ignored. I do not know what to do with myself anymore, I ruin absolutely everything and I really wish I did not wake up in the morning but am also not brave enough to go through anything permanent.

"How To Destroy Fear Before It Destroys You &gt; Fear is the number one inhibitor of taking successful actions; and it is the number one instigator for taking destructive actions.

I was just listening to [a podcast](http://www.borntoprosper.com/how-to-destroy-fear/?ap_id=amandahayward) by Shane Krider and wanted to share here because I think it's relevant to the sub and listening to the podcasts has helped me start taking control of my thoughts and given me more confidence overall. I'm doing all the basics for my anxiety - eating well, exercising, meditation, medication - but this seems to be the icing on the cake for me! Really enjoying it.

"I cant function anymore, my cognitive abilities are much worse than back in the days. i am emotionally unstable and cry a lot. long story short:

for a better understanding, i harmed my body and soul so many times because of untreaded trauma ( i think), i drink booze on the weekends since my 18th birthday, and later some party drugs came in.

if i would have a glimpse of which pain i will live through back in the days i would have never touched any drug.

i had so many breakdowns in the last 3 years and it feels like i will never be the person again i was.

with the booze and the drugs came panic attacks and anxiety disorders.

i am not the same anymore and dont know if this ever will pass.

i feel miserable, no energy, cant laugh anymore, its like being buried alive.

how did some of you guys survived this and are your cognitive functions and general well being better?

i just try with all in my power to get healthy mentally and body.

"Just when I think I've made it, I get pulled back in. I've had so many tests, painful and otherwise, over the past several weeks.  After finally getting a nearly clean bill of health, I brought up with my doctor the one thing I didn't think about until recently. I could feel a swollen lymph node just under my jaw over my carotid artery.  what started to scare me, is that i realized I could feel that lymph node for something like 3 *months*.  My doctor immediately ordered an ultrasound, and this morning I got a really somber call from a nurse at the Dr.'s office saying I needed to see an ENT right away: I not only have the one, but *multiple* enlarged lymph nodes in that area.  My understanding is that the concern from my doctor is not just that there are multilple and they're enlarged (at least one is on the order of 2cm), but that at least one has persisted for so long, and even more alarming, I have no signs of an infection and my bloodwork is clean; apparently persistent enlarged, multiple lymph nodes with clean bloodwork is not a good sign.

I've been freaking out all day and I've been trying to avoid the internet, but the soonest I can get in to see an ENT is next Tuesday, so I get to spend the next 4+ days agonizing about this. I'm 38 years old, and I've been through so many health symptom scares over the past couple of months (mostly heart related) that the anxiety is just making me lose my mind...",2

They even called and its like I was so thrilled to talk with them for awhile and the feeling began to fade.I just do not understand it well.I have lived alone for several years nowand I am accustomed to it even prefer it at times.And yet waking up suddenly this evening the feeling of being alone felt like a prison.

"Overstressing everything Hey, joined this community just now since I kinda need some life advice, from anyone.

I've always been stressing out a lot over various things, but as of recently I started to realise that it has taken over my life in various ways. 

For example, even as of recently I was supposed to drive a group of friends to a theme park. Just a fun day, but the responsibility of driving my friends there somehow made me insanely nervous, even though I was ""calm inside"" if that makes sense. As a result I slept 0 hours in total. Melatonin didn't work, meditating did nothing, breathing exercises did nothing, my mind just kept on racing.  
(p.s. a friend drove in my car for me, I'm not driving on 0 hrs of sleep)

  
It's not just that single event though. School days cause stress, tests cause stress, even having a totally free day but having to receive a package the next day causes sleep issues and stomach aches.   
When doing things I'm always thinking about the worst thing that could happen, and what if that would happen, even if the chances are minimal, which only adds up to the stress.  
Idk anymore, should I visit a psychiatrist? Like what do you do here? This has been ongoing for at least 10 years now, I'm currently 22 and this has to stop

thnx :)",3

"I have basically determined I probably have clinical depression and anxiety. I feel like every aspect of my life is spiraling into the worst state I have ever been in. Physical, mental, sexual health all terrible. Career and relationship feeling stagnant. I have started the process to start therepy soon and plan on joining a gym too. But motivation is difficult. All of this feels extremely overwhelming and like I am drowning in thoughts all day everyday. To my point, my girlfriend wants a second Cat and pretty much begs/pesters me about it every once in a while, then tries to guilt me for not letting her get one. Borderline emotionally manipulative and immature I am going to. Adding/introducing a second cat into our lives is literally not even on my lists of priorities for getting my life in order right now. And my gf does not seem to care that inside my own head I am dealing with a lot more than looking at cute cats and wanting one. Am I being selfish in not allowing her to get one till i feel better and feel like dealing with it, or is she being selfish by not accepting my desires to hold off?As an aside, we did try adding a second cat from a rescue a couples month ago against my wishes (she begged on her birthday till I caved). It went aweful and returning him was very emotionally difficult for the both of us and not something I would like to experience again in my current state.What are your thoughts?

"I have been talking to/going on dates with/hanging out with someone for ~2 months so far. I like them. They like me.

"I am happiest when I am working, but when I am home and do not have anything to distract me, everything comes back. My sadness, my fear, my anxiety and self doubt. I could watch a movie, but then I feel useless and lazy. I could clean my room or my car, but as soon as I start I lose interest or become overwhelmed. I could read a book but I eventually get tired of that. I could serf the internet but that makes my anxiety shoot through the roof. I do not have anything I could be doing other than hobbies, games, tv, or books. I end up just sitting there almost in tears because I cannot seem to move, even though I desperately want to. I need distraction, otherwise I am left with my thoughts, and my thoughts are not kind to me. How do you deal with having time and not knowing what to do with it?",1

"I make posts on Reddit and get tons of replies and it is okay for a few days but then they leave and I am reminded of how lonely I am. I am so needy that I need someone to talk to all throughout the day. I know that people have their own lives and stuff to get done but I feel so unwanted. Like I am so unlikeable that I manage to push everyone away. It does not help that I have the social skills of a rock either.I know what you are going to say, that I am whining and people are dealing with worse and I know that but I just feel so sad right now and I just needed to let it out. I feel like there is a weight in my chest but also like there is nothing there at all. Like I am sad but also not sad. And I do not even have anyone to talk to because every time I bring up my mental health, I end up arguing with my mom. She thinks that happiness is a choice, that I should just reject the depression and it will start to go away. That accepting that I have this problem is just nurturing the sickness so I cannot even talk to her about this.The only friend I have is depressed too so I would not want to burden him. Especially since he is dealing with his own stuff. I feel like an ingrate too because I feel suffocated in our friendship too. it is kind of like having to be a full time therapist. I know that there are people who are constantly sad and he is one of them but sometimes I feel sad and cannot be there for him. I am sorry for rambling, I just needed to let some things out. I feel so alone",1

"Convinced something is wrong with my head/brain I posted this to r/askdocs already but figured l'd share here too.

I'll start by saying l got diagnosed with severe GAD anxiety about a year ago, and l've noticed l've become a huge hypochondriac since then. Lately l've been noticing a few things that have me convinced there's something wrong.

One is that when l run my hand over my head l feel a lot of hard bumps/divits on my skull that l don't remember always being there, and l haven't hit my head recently. I know it's normal to have a few small bumps, but I have one on the top of my head that seems out of the ordinary and l don't know if that should be of concern or not.

The other is that I will randomly get sharp bursts of pain in isolated areas of my head that feel like bad headaches, but only last for like a minute or so. This has been scaring me into thinking l might have brain problems/tumors. I also will feel ""shakey"" but it's only in my head and not all over. I sometimes will get slight numbing/tingling sensations on my head, ears, and side of face. 
Like l mentioned before, l have anxiety so l know some of these could just be anxiety related issues/symptoms, but it seems like something is wrong to me. I don't want to waste my money in getting scans of my brain if unnecessary, but I still am concerned.
I'm a 21 year old female, overall healthy besides the anxiety and mild depression. Any feedback or concerns would be greatly appreciated!",2

A few months ago I had an ulcer in my throat / left tonsil which freaked me out enough at that time but eventually it went away . Now ever since then, my left tonsil seems to be swollen and has stayed this way but with no sensation. Few days ago , got another tonsillitis infection, what to do about this !

"I do not know what I am going through. I have a lot of things that other people would wish for yet I feel I have been given nothing. My life has been a never ending struggle. I know we all fight our own battles but mine, it just never ends. I am 26 year old and I have stopped living. At this point of time, I do not feel happy over anything because of so much that I have seen in my life. I feel afraid seeing any good thing in my life because I know, worse is coming my way. it is just a never ending cycle for me. I get blessed with a good thing, a super worse thing come along it as well. I do not know how much more I can take it. I am not going to kill myself until I have a family. I cannot make them feel worse seeing my lifeless body but when they will not be around, I have plans.

"How do you deal with the friends you cannot open up to? I have someone who is been a part of my life for a VERY long time, but every time I try to talk to him about the fact that I have been struggling, he talks over me to tell me how bad its been for him lately. Like if I say I am doing bad, hell go me too. And then ramble on about everything that is going on in his life. I have tried to talk to him about it and all he said was, Well I have got a lot going on in my life right now. Hope things get better though. And if I text him anything about my issues, like just to complain or get it off my chest, hell ignore me and when I call him out, he just says, Its a lot to process. I am busy Am I a bad friend for just wanting him to listen to me? Its so hard for me to open up and I feel like he does not care at all?? Friends advice",1

"Advice for a future college student As of now im (17f) in the last weeks of my senior year of high school. This time last year, my junior year, I started my first antidepressant: Prozac. That shit made me crazy; I hallucinated, attempted to crash my car, and almost ran away. Now, i’m on Lexapro on a high dosage and i just feel the same as I did without being on antidepressants. My dad originally told me that exercise would help but now im playing varsity softball and only feel good while im playing. when I stop my contention fades. I just feel like i’m moving throughout life with no purpose. My parents keep asking me about college. I got into four of the eleven colleges I applied to. I dont’ have good grades and dont have any motivation to fix it. I’m worried I wont be able to graduate and yet my parents still tell me “to be more productive” and “try harder.” I dont want to waste my parents money and fail out of university if I end up attending. I also feel kind of embarrassed, and I know I shouldn’t, to go to community college. People have told me that community college students are “weird” and “embarrassing.” I know thats not true and theres so many benefits of attending community college. I think i just need to stop listening to people but its easier said than done i guess.",1

He told me he had been keeping an eye on me since he saw Pedo talking to me a lot and hanging around me a lot.

Both girls had quit a couple of months into their jobs, even though they were doing well, seemed happy and very much liked their positions.

Life sucks already, what is one small thing like that going to do?I am nearly 20, alone, and done with high school - and essentially socializing as a whole.The worst dreams for me that make waking up seem so daunting, are the ones where my life is actually enjoyable. Imaginary people I love, or friends I am making. Legitimately enjoying just a small portion of time. Why is life never normally like this?Then I wake up, and realize I am in the same situation. No ones there for me. No one loves me. And I am still alone as everIm so fucking sick and tired of having dreams like this. Just makes my situation feel that much more unbearable.

"Figure I can use this as a place to just make a diary or something. Idk maybe it helps maybe it does not. Anyways the whole purpose of my future posts here will serve as a diary to my life as a depressed person. I decided since my birthday is coming up soon and I have nothing to show for my life that I am giving myself 1 more year and then I am going on a vacation from this plane of existence. I do not have any friends and my parents are getting up there in age so I will be alone soon. No girlfriend and quite honestly it is going to take a fucking miracle for something to heal me and unfuck me up.it is not a doom and gloom entirely. Despite all of this I think there is a glimmer of hope if I can for lack of a better term focus like my life depends on it. If I can at least fix my job situation maybe I can muster enough to find something else but right now the issue , I am depressed as hell. I do not think I can be around people and fake a positive interaction. I am on edge rn and I do not want to offend anyone and at the same time I hate this bullshit game of life where I am having to pretend people are friendly when in reality it is dog eat dog. Working is OK with me so long as I do not have to talk to anyone...at least if I work 24/7 I will not be entirely suffering in this lonely pit.I need to learn how to code and program as quick as possible. This seems like it is my last hope. If I can master this over the course of the year I might live to see 2023. Over the course of August I will be working 40 hours , working out , eating clean, and studying. I am either going to survive this or I am going to die , literally. there is nothing I can see saving me right now and I am losing all hope. This is my last shot.I really wish I did not have to feel this constant heartache and constant want to breakdown in tears. It sucks people are going to judge me because I cannot smile. It sucks that the only way out this is suffering through an intense type of personal hell to where you quite literally die and a new personality is either born or you fail and die.At least there is peace in knowing I choose when I go, sorta.

A couple of years ago I tried some antidepressants and notice something that I never realized when I was in full depression. Anyways what I notice is how depression dulls your senses food does not taste as good smell is not as strong sound or music can seem annoying or to loud. When I got my serotonin boosted from the SSRI all that was gone and everything was so much more enjoyable. It sucks though I had to get off the antidepressant because I was getting side effects but man it is amazing how much serotonin can make a difference.

She went and knocked on my parents room and greeted them, barely awake since we have all just woken up, she could do that; to open doors and not be greeted with disdain, she could walk without having to be on thin ice like me, she was like that. breakfast came, and we have moved on to family matters. How was your mom? how is the business? and she would say everything is okay. My mom asks, why are not you helping her right now? and she answered because their shop was too hot for her, just like that, she had a choice I realized. My mother whispered, you should help as if she was a bad child, but i could feel the guilt on her voice as if she too realized it is not true. My cousin gave a look, reassuring her it does not reallt matter because my mother never guilt trips me about it, She had that freedom. I forget sometimes, this emotions that claw out of my heart, that take root into my head. I envy, and I feel numb, angry and confused.

"New nervous/stress habits. New poster here. I am a 54f professional w a history of depression. I notice I’ve developed new habits of rocking (rare) and chin quivering (frequent!, seems intentional, can stop, but the inclination is def increasing). Full transparency: I’ve started drinking a bit more, but no more than I’ve overindulged in the past due to stress. I am under incredible amounts of increasing, unrelenting, and incomprehensible stress these days due to my employer suddenly changing all policies. I never rocked/quivered before these changes. Just wondering if anyone else has experienced rocking and chin quivering in response to stress. And the influence of alcohol if relevant. Thanks.",3

"Feel like everything thinks i'm annoying and I'm unhappy with how I never stand up for myself. I've been planning my wedding that is happening in May of this year.

I got engaged a few months ago in January, and at first I felt fine with taking on everything but now it's starting to get into my head and I feel overwhelmed everyday.

My days consist of me working, wedding planning, and sleeping. Most of the time if i'm doing something other than that, I'm thinking of my wedding anyways. If I go shopping there's always something that will catch my eye and remind me of what I need to do or purchase for the big day.

Not only that, but my partner is in another country (LDR) and he can only do so much to help me with it all besides pay for things here and there. I live on my own while my partner lives at home (he's never been on his own before) and i'm struggling to pay for small things like a DJ or even cake.

I've tried talking to him about wedding stuff and he tends to get overwhelmed or be distracted with other things he's doing like gaming etc. Last night, I was talking to him about décor options we had and I showed him our ceremony space. It's on a terrace/large outdoor patio at this nice hotel in my city. I went personally to view the venue a week after we got engaged, sent him videos and photos, and he loved it too! Now when i showed him the photos last night he made a few ""not so happy"" faces and I almost started crying right there from the stress of it all. He kept saying ""I guess it'll have to do.."" and things like that. Felt like I screwed it up so bad.

I feel like a failure, that I picked a bad venue...and to top it all off I have a few people in my bridal party who are being really catty towards me now. They keep shitting on me for having ""bad communication"" even though I'm trying my best and have everything on MY shoulders. They haven't offered to do anything specific but constantly say ""I want to help in any way I can! Let me know what to do!"" and I have no clue what to ask them. Also, a bridesmaid of mine really dislikes my MOH and tries to make me feel like she's not doing ""enough"" and says she feels she's unsupportive.

I didn't even want a big wedding at a hotel. I originally imagined a wedding where I am married at a nice park, have dinner at a nice restaurant and then go to a pub for a beer after to celebrate.

The only reason it became a big wedding is because of my in laws and my family coming, plus a bunch of my friends wanted to go. My fiancé is only bringing 3 family members and none of HIS friends are going to come (despite travelling to Mexico for a wedding recently).

After all this, I can see why people elope or have really really small weddings.",3
"I do not want to be dead, I just do not want to live in this world.

I wish I did not have to waste away here. I want the freedom to live a life that I was meant to; one that does not have to be perfect, but is fulfilling at the very least. I am constantly thinking that if I die here, maybe Ill be able to start anew in a different world. But there is no way for me to know. I might just cease to exist. As sucky as that may be, I can accept it, since my pain will end along with me. But I do not know it its worth putting my family and friends through such a heavy loss. I do not want to fade away. I do not want to stop existing. But I also do not want to stay here. I wish I could just go where I was meant to go. I want to live a life of my own image. Please. Someone help me.

My doctor prescribed a low dose (20mg) cymbalta to help with some corneal neuropathic pain. It seemed it help for the few days I took it but then I read all of the issues people have coming off of it versus other antidepressants and discontinued it due to that. My nerve pain is now back and I am on the fence about taking it again since it really did help (I also have some mild anxiety and depression so it was a plus to help with those also). The general consensus online seems to be that it is an absolutely terrible drug to have to taper off of and people seem to develop chronic issues from it even after being off of it a while. My doctor simply tells me do not worry about that when I inquired about the withdrawals. Can any medical professionals give me some input? Is it really that bad for most people? I would like to not be in pain anymore but also do not want to because meow problems for myself in the long run Is tapering off of cymbalta as scary as people make it seem? It helps me but I am scared to keep taking it,1

"Hearing loss At what point do I talk to my doctor about not being able to hear well. I've noticed more and more struggling to hear. Last time I asked she said I just had fluid in my ear and said it would be fine. It's been 6 months since then and I've switched doctors because of her being dismissive on other things. (Rolling eyes, laughing at me etc.) 
I had the flu between then and now. And after the flu it seems like it had gotten a lot worse. And being in public with hearing issues is making my anxiety skyrocket. 

What really scares me even more is my mom had a tumor removed from her ear area that was causing hearing loss. 

What do I do? Can anyone comfort me? Is this a reason to go to the walk in or do i need to make a regular appointment? 

I would of talked to the doctor the 8th but I've had such horrible times with doctors I ended up cancelling because I was having such bad anxiety attacks. (I ordered pizza instead to calm myself, it didn't help) 

I'm not on any anxiety medication. Or anything but birth control. ",2

Advice I wish Id just take for once. Instead I scroll mindlessly or sleep or go to work. I can only seem to muster the will to do obligations. Not the things I love. Its so painful watching everyday go by. It seems so simple to just go and do it. Just start. I start, get tired and stop for the day. Weeks for back and I try again. Nothing works. Some days I feel like there could not possibly be a more lazy human being. Tomorrow Ill go to work..and then Ill fall asleep at maybe 4 in the afternoon. I can swear that I will not but I will. I could give myself a huge pep talk get excited to do the things i want to do, but i still will not. As I have said, I am on meds, I go to therapy. How can I get out of this?

They never forced me do anything and never pressurised me to perform great in school. I did not have a bad social life either there was no bullying in my school, I had good at social interactions with my peers and teachers, and had a great rapo with them. My father came from nothing and achieved everything himself. I feel a pressure to out do him but nobody is telling me to do so. I have screwed up my life academically, I never had to work hard to achieve anything, I was good at sports and academics but slowly as competition started to increase i gave up on things and retreated. I started consoling myself that somehow I am destined to be sucessful and I started to belive it. Everytime I sleep, I hope I do not wake up tomorrow or if I do wake up , I wake up when i was 13 yrs old so I can re do my life with the current wisdom. Everytime my family goes out on vacation I hope they do not come back (die) so I can have an excuse for the failure I will become in future.

"Just heads up, this is going to be a bit of a long post, but any help is appreciated.Hi, so last Monday I acted stupid and started reading some dark depressing reddit posts about what happens after death (the post was in an Atheist pov) and that there is nothing after death. I am normally a very happy guy and I have never really been depressed or sad about anything, but after reading this post I just got super anxious and very nervous about the end. Problem is, before even if I read some depressing shit I was able to snap out of it, but it is been more than a week and I cannot seem to get myself back together. I keep thinking about this. My mind seems to not be able to enjoy life anymore. I am always thinking ""what is the point of all this then if we just go back to nothingness"". I am a recent accounting graduate with a full time offer lined up this year but I am not even excited for that anymore. I went to the fourth of july fireworks this past Sunday, and while everyone was ""wowing"" &amp; ""whoaing"", I was just blankly sitting there deathly afraid of one day ultimately LOSING the beauty of Earth. My family was watching the fireworks next to me and I just got really sad knowing one day I will lose them all, and they will lose me. I have a beautiful and wonderful girlfriend who we LAUGH together all the time. I went to IKEA with her this past Monday and while I am usually very happy around her, I just kept getting sucked back into the anxious mindset of one day LOSING her too. What the fuck am I experiencing and how do I snap myself out of it. When I start thinking about that post I can physically feel my brain numbing and hurting a little, like as if my brain cannot comprehend that I am ultimately not special and that I will turn to dust into nothing, into the void. I have always known that we will all die one day, but I have never WORRIED about it because we are all just temporary tenants of this Earth. I am just always sad now thinking all the beauty of life, family, girlfriend, will eventually and certainly END. PLEASE, any help is appreciated. I just want to enjoy life, I do not want to keep having to think about this stupid thought. I should have never read the reddit post. My motivation, aspirations, are all sort of gone.... Please help, am I experiencing Depression?",1
"Stress Headache? Hi 27M, 185lbs, 5'11 here. The last two days I've been pretty stressed out with work and started noticing that to the left of my left eye little close to the side forehead I've been getting this awful pinching feeling that comes and goes. I drink some caffeine during the day, but today decided to lay off of it and it's still coming in waves. The best I can describe it as a pinching vain. I started worrying that it might be a stroke or aneurysm but quickly chalked that up to just being anxiety. I've been feeling a little ""foggy minded"" too so I wonder if that has come to play too? Yesterday night I drank a few beers and it seemed to help, but then came back when I was sober. I take an antidepressant, and Ritalin daily but have been on them for years so I really don't think that's the case. Does anyone else get this headache feeling? if so, remedies? or should I go see a doctor? thanks.",3

I had gestational diabetes last summer and experienced symptoms with it - dizziness, fatigue, nausea, thirst, frequent urination, headache. I had the baby in September and everything went back to normal. About 2 weeks ago, all these symptoms returned but worse. I went back to the diabetic diet and started walking, most symptoms are gone with doing this- but if I vary at all, I get SO SICK - and gain 3-5 lbs overnight. I still have headache and bloating even on the diet... I know I probably have diabetes- it runs in my family. But I don’t have insurance and my husband is unemployed until June.

"I have had depression for as long as I can remember. It started in grade school, dealing with a mentally abusive and neglectful father, a school and student body that hated me, and wanted me dead. As I grew, it only got worse. I had a house fire, and was made fun of for it. Once I got into high school, I made the most amount of friends that I ever had. But it did not stop others from making my life miserable. Once out of school, my friends slowly started to disperse. They all eventually told me that they had forgotten I even existed. Now I have no one to talk to. I am awful at relationships, and I have given up on that. I am a quiet introvert, who has a hard time opening up, especially to complete strangers, but I am desperate. I hate feeling like this, but its all I have ever known. I just want to know that someone, somewhere cares. Idk what else to do if this fails In need of support, somehow.",1

"If you’re wondering whether adverse childhood experiences are negatively impacting you as an adult, you probably already know the answer. In my work as a hypnotherapist most of my clients are mature adults experiencing issues rooted in anger, anxiety, depression - or a mixture of these. Often, they are wondering if their present issues are linked to their childhood experiences. More often than not, the answer is yes. 

Research carried out since the end of the last century has led to a greater understanding of how adverse childhood experiences impact on long term wellbeing – both physical and psychological. The key findings are:

· Childhood trauma is very common: even in so-called well-to-do areas.

· There is a direct link between childhood trauma and chronic disease in adulthood.

· The more types of trauma a child experiences, the greater the risk of them of experiencing social and emotional problems as adults.

· Those who experience childhood trauma often experience more than one type of trauma.

You can calculate your own ACEs score by responding to the following questions. Give yourself 1 point for each question where you experienced that category of trauma before your eighteenth birthday. 

1. Emotional abuse: Did a parent or other adult often or very often insult, demean, belittle, humiliate, verbally assault, or threaten to physically assault You? 

2. Physical abuse: Did a parent or other adult often or very often grab, slap, push, or hit You? 

3. Sexual abuse: Did a parent, adult, or someone at least five years older than you ever touch your body in a sexual way or attempt or have oral, anal, or vaginal intercourse with You? 

4. Emotional neglect: Did You often or very often feel that no one in your family loved you or thought you were important; or your family did not look out for each other, feel close to each other, and support each other? 

5. Physical neglect: Did You often not have enough to eat, had to wear dirty clothes, had no one to attend to your medical and dental needs, or had no one to protect you? 

6. Loss of parent: Were your parents separated or divorced, or did you lose a parent for any reason? 

7. Domestic violence: Did You often or very often witness or hear violence between your parents or other adults where someone was being grabbed, shoved, slapped, hit, kicked, had something thrown a them, sexually attacked, or threatened with a weapon? 

8. Family member with addiction: Did You live with anyone who was a problem drinker or alcoholic, who used illicit drugs, or who was addicted to any other substances? 

9. Family member with depression/mental illness: Did you live with anyone who was depressed or mentally ill, attempted or committed self-harm and/or suicide, or hospitalized for mental illness? 

10. Family member incarcerated: Did you live with anyone who went to prison? 

ACES Score (0-10) = 

As ACE scores increase, so does the risk of disease, social and emotional problems. With an ACE score of four or more, things start getting serious. While studies in different locations return slightly different results, the figures suggest around 11% of the population have experienced four or more adverse childhood experiences.  

Fortunately, brains and lives are somewhat plastic. Resilience research shows that the appropriate integration of resilience factors — such as asking for help, developing trusting relationships, forming a positive attitude, listening to feelings — can help people improve their lives. Research in to post traumatic growth has identified five broad areas of growth:

· greater appreciation of life, 

· closer relationships with others, 

· increased personal strength, 

· new possibilities in life, and 

· spiritual “development

Which correlate very closely with the dimensions of wellbeing psychology:

· Positive emotions

· Positive engagement

· Positive relationships

· Positive meaning

· Positive accomplishments

· Positive health",3

"I live with my strict parents and work from home. Last week, my parents went outside to do some business in the afternoon and I was home alone. Usually in the afternoon, I feel lethargic, sleepy and just depressed, and I end up dozing off all day. But as soon as my parents left the house, I was wide awake. I was doing the things that I needed/wanted to do without being distracted, and I was not feeling lethargic at all. Then when my parents came home, my mind just crashed and I fell asleep.

I work in an urgent care and I got reprimanded. The first one was when I found a woman bleeding on the ground right outside the clinic and I went inside to get help because I could not lift her by myself. I told the PA and everyone pretty much rushed outside except me and one other person because I just got there and had to put my stuff down. But they think I completely ignored the patient and walked by them when I was the one who found her and got help. The reason I did not go with them was because someone had to keep seeing the patients. They were backed up already and there were 5 people already going outside to help her that it would have made no sense for me to go with them. They did not even try to clear things up with me. They just assumed that I did not want to help and told my supervisor which is bullshit. They think I am horrible because of a misunderstanding. And then I messed up by not putting the patient in the bed when putting an IV in. They fainted and started convulsing which could have hurt them badly if they hit their head. I know I screwed up big time and I just cannot get over it. I was going to go part time once school started in fall. But now I think I should just quit. Maybe I just do not belong in health care and its a mistake going to nursing school. that is all I know how to do and I cannot even do things right.

"hantavirus?!? hello fellow reddit people. i go over to my boyfriends every weekend and i think it was the 29th of december when i went to start packing, i opened the dresser and seen that the mice chewed through some wood and shit everywhere. one shirt had a massive pile of crap and wood shavings on it and got all through my clothes. so i just started taking them all out except for the one shirt that had the most droppings. i haven’t open the closet till i needed a shirt tuesday, put it on and forgot about the mice poop but i didn’t think much of it. i got really bummed thinking about how pretty much all my clothes were destroyed with mice feces and urine (i’ll admit i let them go for about a week). so last night i put gloves on and put all my clothes in trash bags. i threw away the shirt that had the main crap on it. then i started vacuuming out my drawers with a shirt tied around my neck cause i was scared to breathe it in. then of course i got online and started reading about the virus and began to go into panic mode.  i read that if you vacuumed the poop up it can become airborne but i didn’t worry about that until after i started overthinking. i slept two hours because i was so terrified that i was gonna die in my sleep. this morning i got so frightened with getting the ‘hantavirus’ that i immediately went to the ER and they took my blood, urine and an EKG. the tests came back fine turns out i’m just dehydrated. yet my anxiety still is causing me to freak out and constantly thing i have the virus. i’m scared to death (literally). my anxiety is making me think also that they misdiagnosed me which happens a lot with this disease. my boyfriend and many people have reassured me that i’m okay and that i didn’t get the virus yet idk if it’s my anxiety mimicking the symptoms of the virus or what but i’m very positive that i will be dead soon. i just need some opinions from strangers i guess?",2

"34F, depressed since 8yo. How I can handle it until now?! I am so empty and lonely. Live hurts! Wakeup hurts. I cannot stand anymore. I want to die but I do not want to kill myself.I faked I am ok every day to everyone bc no one has more patience with my situation. I do therapy every week and I do not know how I have a job! Why they do not fire me?! I am useless. In 2019 my Bf moved to another country (we were together just for 6 months until she moves) - I love her but have been depressed and in a long distance relationship for 2 yrs and a half just turns the things worst! I believe that if I break up the relationship I will can have a chance to know someone who lives e want to stay with me truly. What I said that you can asked. My bf told me that she does not want me to move with her without getting a job in the country where she is living now. She has residence, and I do not. I would have to apply for a residence visa and with this depression I can barely stay here, where I am. I understand her concerns about the home situation. But I do not agree.What should I do?!

"Health Anxiety Effects English is not my first language so apologies for any grammar mistakes. So I've been having Health Anxiety, mostly due to the apparition of a dark spot in my stomach, and some sores in my scalp. Initially I didn't worry about it, but it started spreading, and I was convinced that it was some cancer tumor. That coupled with upset stomach made me live day after day with anxiety about my health. It's been two months with this anxiety, I've been to the doctor and he said I have a healthy stomach, besides my colon being upset and having a infection. I'm on medication for that. Been to two different dermatologist for the spot in my chest, said it was dermatitis and got medication for it. Still, I'm anxious about my health, and been feeling dizzy lately. I been coping with my parents divorce, economic issues and think I might have depression. What are the effects of Health Anxiety? Think it might be worsening my health",2

"Looking for some advice I just know how ridiculous this is going to sound and I would like to apologize in advance for that.

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since Rachel Star Withers' face was eaten away by flesh-eating bacteria, I have been living under the constant fear that I might end up with the same fate as hers. I know how rare necrotizing fasciitis is (0.0004%) but I just can't seem to get my mind off it. I have, because of this, become a germaphobe and was compelled to wash my hands with soap after picking up anything from a surface that I consider just a bit unclean. As a result, my overly dry hands are now cracking and it's creating small, tiny wounds on my skin, which only made the situation worse cause necrotizing fasciitis usually occurs with certain types of bacteria entering wounds on one's skin. I understand that the best thing to do right now is to stay away from this irrational hand washing habit of mine but I simply can't do it. To make things worse, I always feel like I have touched something dirty when in reality, I haven't. For instance, when I walk pass a trash can a bit too close, I feel really uncomfortable and go straight to the bathroom to wash my hands. I only came close to touching it, but my mind is telling me that I have, indeed, already touched it.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been going through hypochondria for quite some time but now I really feel like I'm going crazy. Has anybody ever experienced this? Can some of you please give me some advice on this. From how to deal with the flesh-eating bacteria craze to how to stop being a germaphobe. It can be anything. I just want all this to stop.

Is there anything that I can do",2

"Health anxiety is steering me towards a nervous breakdown My health anxiety is getting the best of me lately. Been having eye floaters the last few years and tinnitus so I was obsessing over a brain tumor. Then lately it turned into colon cancer and pancreatic cancer due to stomach issues. Now I woke up this morning and smelled burnt rubber or something similar to it and now I'm back to freaking out over a brain tumor because I couldn't figure out if it was real or not. I did have my bedroom window open which faces the parking lot of my apartment complex and I didn't smell the smell when I went into the other room but still it freaked me out and now I'm obsessing over that. No I'm not sick and don't have nor have had covid. I've seen two old neighbors of mine die from it within months and that's the root of my anxiety with it and now with this what I think was a phantom smell, I'm terrified. And now I can't tell if what I'm smelling is real or not. I came in from walking my dog and thought I smelled the burnt rubber again but it was just my coffee brewing. 

I literally feel like I'm at my wits end. I can't find a therapist due to time scheduling conflicts with my job. I was prescribed a medication by my PCP but I don't like how anti depressants affect my sex drive (the one thing that helps me cope with all of this). The health anxiety is just getting worse the older I get too (35 now). It sends me into deep depressions and I feel like it's ruining my life at this point. It's like I have a choice to either be medicated and impotent or keep spiraling mentally. I hate this. I hate my brain and that it thinks this way. And I hate that you can get a fatal disease no matter how healthy you try to live your life. I'm so full of anger right now over all of this. I'm at work now and have such bad brain fog over all of this to the point where it feels dreamlike.",2

The first time I noticed abuse was when he wanted to repeatedly have sex till I was sore, and would get angry if I refused. It was subtle at first but it scared me. As time went on I would here everyday how I was too skinny, I need to gain some weight.. it got to the point to where I would ask questions about why I wasn’t good enough and was depressed ... he would throw a speaker in a room along with me and put stuff in front of the door to where I couldn’t get out.",3

Like maybe after this next game comes out or or after I see this movie etc… but I’m now 23 and the coping mechanism I’ve developed are starting to fail me now. And I struggle with finding anything else to keep me from going over the edge and ending it all. It has gotten to the point where I was waiting for a train the other day and I heard the train coming and for a second I felt the urge like my body tending up waiting to move as if to jump in front of the train. I ended up thinking to much and didn’t jump but the feeling was real and I was scared. I don’t know what to do anymore.",1

Dark thoughts are slowly taking over my head, i feel like the devil is inside of me and its manipulating and seducing me to go deeper on my dark thoughts. I daily think about suicide, self harm, murder, rape and situations of my past that have made scars on my brain and skin that did not finish healing.

I hate thinking that there is no point to fight for anything anymore, but what am I really doing, just staying up stuck with so many horrible thoughts every night? Nobody cares about our planet. People are dying. Communities seem to be tearing apart. there is no more positivity anywhere.

Yet, I am just a minor and I really do not want to make my parents upset. Back in middle school, I harmed myself. Not too long after, my parents discovered self inflicted cuts. They asked me what I was so upset over. I could not answer them. The truth is, I could not really pinpoint what made me do it. I lied and told them that people were talking behind my back. They did not really take it seriously. They just told me that I should be grateful because I had a roof over my head and a good family. The school therapist did see me a few times, but it did not help at all. If anything, it made me feel ashamed of myself. Even earlier on, a teacher thought I had ADHD because I showed little interest in class. My parents ignored it. Everyone thinks I am doing well off because I get good grades and I am good at faking a smile. In reality, i do not know how much longer i can take any of this. I either feel nothing or intense dread at times. I am constantly hoping that time will pass in the blink of an eye. I am working so much that I feel like I am on autopilot. I do not feel like myself.

"Got prescribed inderal (propranolol) So I went to my GP (general practitioner aka your family doctor) and told her I had been feeling anxious lately, especially before big exams or oral presentations (I start shaking and feeling physically sick, unfocused, can't think straight, etc). She gave me a prescription for inderal and told me to take it on days when I have exams or big events.

However, I googled and it just looks like something to lower your blood pressure. So not that I'm complaining because, honestly, anything helps, but isn't this just going to treat the physical symptoms instead of the overlying issue aka the anxiety? It just sounds like I'll still have the mental anxiety, just with a lower heartbeat lmao

I went home after finals week and my stress level dramatically decreased as I realized how well I did in my classes and I was able to decompress while at home. I went on a ski trip with my family in the middle of the break, right after Christmas, and I felt no symptoms at any time during that trip. I felt fantastic. As I came home and started to prepare to go back to school, I started feeling anxious that I would fall down into the same anxiety rabbit hole again in the second semester, and gradually the weakness and numbness started to come back. Now that I’ve been back at school for 8 days and the anxiety has persisted (albeit less severe) I’m still feeling tightness in the right side of my neck and in my right leg, as well as weakness and numbness in my right limbs. The symptom that is scaring me though is that my right arm feels dead, and I have aches in my shoulder and upper arm that really change in severity depending on the time and on what my arm is doing or where it is.

I just feel so stupid about this. It’s following the same trends as it did last semester and that all went away when I stopped stressing. Now I’m stressing again, but for some reason my mind doesn’t want to attribute this to the stress and I keep worrying that it’s a horrible disease coming to claim my life. Anyone have any input on a situation like this?",2

I was diagnosed with depression around 5 years ago by a doctor but I thought I did not have it because I do not feel unhappy or have negative thoughts.However I am terrible about motivation and feel intimidated at the thought of leaving the house and going outside.Does that mean I do in fact have mild depression like the doctor said?What advice do you have for me?

"After the pandemic started my mother and my sisters addiction issues went out of control. My (F21) own anxiety and depression got so horrible, and trying to be there for my family was exhausting. I was put on academic probation for a summer 2020 course that I failed and then fall and spring I failed a few more classes (all online). I got kicked out of school but everyone told me it would be okay because I could appeal and get back in for fall. I just received word today that the university committee felt that I needed to focus on my mental health more so they denied my appeal and I will not be allowed to apply to the university for at least a year. I worked so hard on my appeal and started going to therapy so that I could get back in school but now I just feel worthless and hopeless, like some unusable product of my familys trauma. I am having such horrible thoughts about myself and what I want to do to myself. I know I can go to community college but my parents will be so disappointed in me when they find out. I am not looking forward to just working minimum wage jobs the rest of my life. I got fat during the pandemic and I just want to give up on getting healthy again, I want to give up on everything now.

Found this group by google how I have been feeling for the longest time. Everyday I try to just sleep and stay in bed for as long as I can (way past 2pm) if I get up its for some mundane task or to take a shower. I have barely gone to work in the last few months using every excuse from Covid to just not feeling well/ lying about doing something else. I have all of the sudden just now look forward until around 6pm to justify drinking just to go to sleep and repeat it all over. Over the last few years I have exiled pretty much all of my friends by either just not contacting or making some lame excuse not to see anyone and some of the closest just blowing up on them for absolutely no just reason.. and if I do meet up with someone I feel like I am just glued to my phone and bored with that person - that urge that I do not want to be there or talk its tiring feeling. Its almost like I do not care anymore. I am still fairly young in my late 20s. I have seen a therapist but she is a bit older and I do not know I do not feel like being put on any pills etc - they were useless and just made me even more tired. How do you all force yourself out of bed and to do life? If that made sense? Do I create a schedule?Love to talk to someone that can relate. Sorry for the sporadic typing - this is my first time really writing and trying to understand myself. Which I do not think is possible. Unmotivated and just wasting my days and life.,1

"I know that is the most common question asked by people lacking empathy (heavy? ""Try eating less,"" poor? ""Try working harder or spending less,"") and I wonder if I have not internalized it from decades of people being insensitive about or inconvenienced by my depression. Still, even I look at myself in these moments piled in bed or hiding in the bathroom struggling to even post on Reddit let alone do something useful and productive and think, ""Well why not fold laundry while you are feeling down? Just one piece at a time, Abacus. You may still be depressed but at least the laundry will be folded. And those little successes will make you feel better!""It sounds so reasonable when someone gives me that pep talk or I say it to myself but it is . . . not what happens. Like many people with depression and ADHD I have been branded as lazy and, honestly, I see myself that way. How do I know I am not? ""Who would not want to stay in bed all day playing games on their Nintendo?"" Or, as the people asking me this often pronounce it, 'N-tin-dough.'I am well into adulthood now so I do not actually hear that much anymore. People just write me off or get annoyed or, at best, pitying. I have been running in this same circle for so long. it is cost me so much. I really cannot complain about my life; I have gotten way more out of it than I put in. But it hurts. And I am so tired of it. I have been on antidepressants my entire adult life. Been in talk therapy off an on for that same span. Looks like I might try TMS next depending on what my doctor wants. I am a little worried about it but I would do virtually anything now to stop feeling this way and to be a more useful, dependable person for those around me. In the immortal words of Philip J. Fry, ""Why is those things?"" Why cannot I make like Nike and ""just do it""? If I know I am laying in bed, staring at my phone, ignoring my responsibilities because of depression, why cannot I just get up and go through the motions?",1

"Crazy how powerful thought diaries &amp; breathing techniques have been for my anxiety  I've been undergoing therapy for anxiety and depression for the past two months. My therapist recommended that I start keeping a ""thought diary"" to write down any worries or concerns that I may have and to practice a breathing technique that involves breathing in for four seconds, holding for two, and then exhaling for four seconds.

Initially, I was skeptical that these simple practices could make a difference in something that has troubled me for years. However, I began to notice that whenever I started to become consumed by anxious or depressive thoughts, jotting them down in my diary helped me immensely. This process allowed me to break down those thoughts and identify that 99% of the time, my worries and depression stem from hypothetical situations.

For instance, one of my thoughts was, ""What if my friends are judging me behind my back?"" (for context, this was after we went out for drinks). The key phrase in that being 'What if', meaning it's just hypothetical with no real evidence to back up the worry. So, in my thought diary, alongside my worrisome thought, I would write down a 'Helpful thought' where I deconstruct this worry. For the aforementioned thought, my helpful thought was:

""This is a hypothetical worry, you have no evidence to suggest this will happen. Your friend's opinion of you shouldn't be taken seriously anyway. You don't need to seek approval from your friends.""

Of course, this may not help everyone, but I wanted to share how thought diaries have helped my mental health, and they can be quite powerful.

 TL;DR: My therapist recommended keeping a ""thought diary"" and practicing breathing techniques to help my anxiety and depression. Writing down my thoughts and using the breathing technique has helped me identify that 99% of my worries are hypothetical. I recommend trying it out.",2

I saw a doctor about the eye floaters, but **was told that those are normal**, and most people get them.

I'm conflicted because I have a smartphone compulsion, which feeds my fear of visual impairment.

I just want to know how I can overcome **these fears because they often give me anxiety**, and I almost cried once out of fear my vision was getting cloudy.

"I have some pretty bad brain fog. here is some symptoms I have:Always feeling extremely stupid, confusing (two) things all the time (e.g. words), having trouble to articulate and form sentences, very bad logical thinking, wetting the bed almost each night, trouble to learn and concentrate, feeling tired, forgetfulness (e.g. remembering something I did not too long ago), slow processing and oh boy this list goes on.I am so worried about work life because of this.Can anyone relate and have experience with this? I just wanted to know if this lasts forever or if the symptom goes away? Its because is definitely my depression. This brain fog",1

"I am only existing. And only for the sake of my parents, my brother and my best friend. Literally those are all the people that are at least giving the slightest shit about me being still here. I want to kill myself so bad but I do not want them to be sad or to blame themselves. that is literally the only thing that is keeping me here, and the fact that I would be too scared to fail. I am trying to survive everyday and each day it gets harder and just more exhausting. I am at university. Do I want to? Nope. Do I do anything for it? Nope. Would I want anything else? Also nope. Am I just doing this so my mom can think I have everything under control? Yes. I am so tired and exhausted. I do not care about nothing and I do not enjoy anything anymore, for so fucking long. I just want it to stop, I really really, really do not want to be here anymore, trying the best I still can, only for the sake of like 4 people. I am so fucking tired. Stuck",1

"I am one of those former gifted kids that was in all the advanced classes basically until I hit high school and got depressed. Then I was just passing regular classes with ok grades, no problem. Parents are evangelical christians and think that therapy is either just for literal psychopaths or an excuse for me to get hooked on drugs. Fine, whatever, I can live without it. I hit college and things go ok for a couple of years. Then the pandemic hits, and everything goes to hell. Its so easy with online classes to say Ill do it later, especially when they are asynchronous. Ill do it later turns into Ill do two days worth of work tomorrow and then I can catch up on everything over the weekend. Except, you never do. And then the anxiety hits, and you feel awful for not doing work, so its on your mind 24/7. But you do not actually have the motivation to go do the work, and you end up burying yourself in some instant gratification trying to hide from the anxiety and get out of actually putting effort into anything. Except, this just feeds the anxiety more, which makes you delve into more instant gratification, and the cycle repeats endlessly. This has been my life for the past year and a half. Its maddening, and I honestly regret not killing myself when I was 16. At least then I would not have to deal with this. Even with only one class to focus on this summer the cycle is as vicious as ever, with no end in sight besides failure. I just want to break the cycle but it does a real good job of keeping you sucked in. Depression + Anxiety has destroyed my ability to function as a student",1

"Overwhelmed, tired, scared I’m typing this after realizing the amount of mistakes I made these past few weeks at work. It’s been so hard to focus and I’m finding that I can’t understand basic (so they seem) task requirements.
Desk job, working with numbers and reports, Maths have never been my forte, I’m surprised even to this very day how I’ve been hired and still work here after many years. I feel like I’m always behind everyone else and I can’t use logic when looking at numbers. 
Well this time the mistake I made was because I/we haven’t checked some figures, I didn’t get help (my manager is on holidays, other members of the team are busy with their stuff), I didn’t connect the dots.
I just can’t do it anymore. I live under constant pressure due to work, so many sleepless nights, thoughts racing in my head, stupid scenarios I build, poor nutrition and so many times of crying uncontrollably.
I don’t want to blame external factors but there has been constant miscommunication which also led to where we’re at. 
My therapist can only help so much, I always feel great after each session and it looks like have the right tools and mindset to get better, but inherently I’m always on the edge, stressed and scared of consequences.
I felt like venting and writing down my pain, typing this in tears, feeling so useless and stupid, but it felt good sharing this here.",3
"I am 21 years old. I have not been diagnosed with depression but I am pretty sure there is something wrong with me.

I do not feel like I enjoy anything anymore, not when I watch tv, not when I read a book, not when i get good grades. I cry many nights and there is never a particular reason for it. But I never told my psychologist any of this because at first I thought it would go away and now I am just scared. I feel like everything I do is just because I am supposed to do it, like being good at college, trying to lose weight and be healthy, practicing to get better at some hobby, etc. but I just do not feel happy. And I do not know what do about it. I also feel like I am so lame to be around lately because I never have anything interesting to say, never have a story to tell. I am just tired. I am tired",1

"During this time, my mother was out of work and she had to make sure she took the time to take care of her father. On his deathbed, my grandpa told our landlord, to his face and perhaps in a Will (the latter was my mother's words, not mine) that he did not want his daughter and his granddaughter to be homeless. He wanted him to take care of us and make sure we had a place to live. Unbeknownst to me, we were behind on the rent. I didn't know how much until a few years later, when I got my first job.",3
so the next fall is deeper and harder to bear each time there s one little glimmer of hope i know that it s ephemeral and could be gone the next day but i can t stop myself from getting lost in it thinking maybe this time it could be real for a while and some time it doe lurking there for a while like just right then but when it s lost it s going down ten time worse than the last and the anxious and unbearable state i m in is urging me to destroy myself even more it s like being locked inside a transparent box full of insect and reptile crawling over me it s slowburn and icky and suffocating i just want to bite my tongue off quick to release myself from the situation but i m still scared of the monstrous pain that act would cause me and if i m not dead immediately it s grotesque i made a first post here a while ago just to let it out i don t think anyone would care but i got called a very nasty stupid word like i m always afraid would happen if i even complain in real life so i don t even want to talk about it right now i just can t take any more anxiety i don t even want to think about it and write them down anyway same shit all over again why don t i get used to it when it keep happening am i that weak it s like how dare you have depression and suicidal attempt if your life look like you re having a fucking blast believe me it s all a big facade i m putting up so i could delay the speed of this horrible decay inside me to feel a bit bearable to last one more day but nowadays i just stop giving a fuck and destroy everything in my life and lock myself inside my room i use humor and shit to cope so i think at least there s one good thing coming from this right now is that i couldn t eat a thing so i m getting thinner to bone and skin like i always wish and if i die right now i could look prettier than ever before i m glad you read until now and i do appreciate that it make me feel a bit bearable for now my anxiety level keep shooting through the roof i just try really really hard to not harm myself and fall to the pit again,1

"Got the ADHD from my mom and the depression from my dad. it is an unbearable combination. For some weeks I think that everything is possible and I can achieve everything I want, but I am too restless to focus on anything so I fail mercilessly. And when I realize that nothing worked out (again...), I cannot leave my bed and I want to kill myself. that is what my life has been for the last 10 years. Yeah, knowing that the shitty depressive times do not last forever is a small consolation, but I also know that the depression will be back, so I do not see a point in getting my life on track just to ruin it shortly after. I am not made for this life, I cannot contribute to this society if my mood is not stable at all. I am afraid of the future and just want to stop existing. I see myself living on the streets in 5 years because I cannot keep a job for long and no one will just give me money so I can lie in bed and cry all day and night. I am a genetic disaster",1

"I remember that I used to be excited about things intrinsically. I was excited about the topics I learnt in school because they were cool and because I loved discussing them with people. At that time I could not answer the question if you knew you could not fail what would you do?. And I still cannot. But at that time I would spring from topic to topic because they were interesting. Now that I have started working full time (fully remote) I cannot find the price of me that causes me to full engage with a thing. I cannot find the so-called flow state. Partly I think because I have become disillusioned by the ends achieved by my work, and partly because I do not know people I can share my work with in the same way I did in school and also because work ties me to a single project. Because I cannot access the flow state I do not know that any part of my work (or any other side project) is truly exciting to me.When I look to the future and think about what job I want I know that I want a job where the ends are satisfying the work is interesting and I can access the flow state. But when I make that concrete and ask should I pursue job X? Or what do I need to do to achieve Y? And I look at what I need to do to get there the motivation fades and the doubt creeps in. Am I really good enough to achieve that? Is that what I really want? If I put all the work in to get there will I feel as empty as I do now? I feel like those questions do not arise in a person without depression. I find myself questioning motives when the road ahead is slightly difficult.",1

"I have not been diagnosed with depression yet, but I do feel like something is not right and I will be going to a therapist soon.I feel super confused. My mother finally started listening to me, and stopped invalidating me, and it feels super weird.Although I stopped cutting (for now), and instead of thinking about suicide every hour, I only do it a few times a day, I do not feel better. I feel like I trapped myself. I was already going to plan out my suicide, and date and stuff, and my mother starts caring. Now I feel the responsibility bringing me down. After seeing her crying during one of our talks, I feel like I cannot do this to her. I cannot kill myself like this.But I want to die. I will never be better. I am a total loser and a failure, I have a few health conditions ruining my life quality too. I honestly do not want to get happier. I just want to restart life. I feel so weak and bad for saying this, but I do not want to improve my mental health. I am not excited about the therapist. I feel so trapped. And I feel so angry at myself. Why am I like this. Why do I bring destruction everywhere I go.I feel so terrible about myself. Maybe I am even faking depression, since I am capable of getting out of bed, and stuff, I just feel terrible and sad all the time. My thoughts and feelings are killing me. I just want to disappear...

"I do not know how to even talk about this but it is fucked up. I have been depressed for years, but when my sister died last month things have got ten times worse. to top it off, she was cremated, and she was nine. Fucking NINE.I still feel like a bitch for being angry at it. I had to delete my last account after i got bullied because I posted about my frustration on a grief support sub. it is not fucking fair. I had people tell me to grow up, calling me a sensitive bitch, swearing at me and villainising me because I am pissed off a nine year old girl was burnt to ashes. Can I not just be angry at that!?And I do not care that the morticians are kind. I do not care that the bitch who did her cremation sent me a tacky memorial gift and a necklace with her fucking powdered bones in it that I did not ask for anyway. I know all the goddamn machines my sister was put through, and I got her back in a fucking plastic bag, and now I am sitting here, drunk off my ass, holding my sister's ugly ass urn and crying. I do not want to hear from the cunt that turned her into this that she wanted to help me.Then there is my mum too, saying she had my sister burnt so I could have her ashes to help me cope? And the morticians talking about wanting to comfort me!? And get this, the bitch who did it is a self proclaimed""grief counselor"" and Is coming over on Thursday to help me with my loss when she made it ten times worse. Can I not just be angry about this without being told I am projecting. I do not care that nobody wants to cremate a kid and that it is hard to do, but if you do that you deserve to feel like shit. Let me be angry. Stop defending the people who are in my eyes monsters and just let me grieve. Let me hate these people. And the woman who did her cremation, Heidi, fuck her. And fuck her constantly saying my sister's ""with God"" and constantly thinking this is comforting when I was the one who was abused by a priest. I cannot even hate religion without being told I am wrong. Just let me be angry.",1

It hurts just as much as the day it happened, and I do not know who I am or what value I have without them.Every day is a struggle to get through, and I feel like I cannot keep living like this; always suicidal and thinking about how the only people who is opinions I cared about do not care if I live or die.I have nightmares regularly of them all in front of me telling me how horrible I am.

"I created CocoonWeaver to help. It’s a free, privacy focused app that sorts audio recordings, transcribed, into categories. There are numerous benefits to self talk, in particular it can decompress mental states and reduce stress. I hope you enjoy! Sometimes, it’s overwhelming to think about all the stressful things. When you let go of them, you can take solace in the fact they remain in a safe space, but no longer occupying headspace. I developed CocoonWeaver because of a dream I had. My dream was about an app that would be intuitive enough to release the many fleeting thoughts that occupy ones mind. Since then, it has been developed in to a working product, and improved with the help of kind feedback from various neurodivergent communities. I would love to take feedback from this community as well, if you have a moment to download the app and share your feedback I would be extremely grateful. 

The app is completely free and it is completely private, nothing leaves your device and everything is stored on your phone.

Thank you so much for your time! &lt;3

"So this all started about 6 months ago, my grandma had a stroke and was dying (we did not know if it would take a week maybe a few months we were not sure). So I decided to book a flight for me and my Fianc down to visit as I have not had the chance to visit in 6 years. The week of the flight all three of my vehicles broke down to where it would cost more to repair them than they were worth, that was not too bad, I had a little money saved up because my fianc and I were trying to save for a house. I figured I would dip into that and replace them when I get back, it was a bummer for sure though. I get down to Florida and my grandma does not even remember who I am which tore me up. I felt so bad because I had not been down to see her in awhile and by the time I did she could not hardly speak and her dreams were more reality than her grandson sitting in front of her. While I was down I figured I would visit my best friend of 15 years and we hung out for awhile and the next day I went to go spend time with my family. My fianc did not want to go so I left her at the house while I was visiting. Turns out my fianc was screwing my best friend while I was visiting my family. I only caught her because I woke up at 3am that night had a bad feeling and looked at her phone.I was devastated and that tore me up bad. I could not believe it. We were together 6 years and I never expected this out of my best friend or her. I was blindsided. Turns out when we gamed on Xbox together they had been chatting for awhile before this and took the opportunity to hook up while I was down to see my dying grandma. Went back home, I tried to mend things but when it was clear she did not want to I did my best to move on. At this point I am back home, sad I just lost my best friend, my fianc, and soon to lose my grandma, and still bummed about my vehicles I did not know what to do. I got super depressed, went drinking with some family, and then decided to do my best to use the pain to better my life. I read two 450 page self help books, I found a better career for myself that pays really well, I started working out and yet, everyday I think about my fianc. I wish I could stop and I hate it and no matter how much I improve my life I am still sad all the time. I just found out about a week ago my x fianc moved down to my x best friend and they got a place and are living together. It basically reset my depression, and then my grandma just passed and I am not sure what to think, feels like I am back at square one. Its been just over 6 months since all this happened to me and I am still broken from it. How long does it take people to heal? This has been pretty traumatic for me. I just want to suck it up and move on. I Had a lot of bad things happen to me recently-ish",1

Once I had mentioned to a friend how I hadn't wanted sex and hoped that jacking off would be good enough, and having overheard this my punishment was to be slammed into the wall and the table then thrown to the floor. When I pushed him back, telling him to quit, he kicked me down to the ground and heel kicked my back until I had a panic attack and collapsed unable to breathe... I spent most nights waiting for him to pass out, which he never did, and running through our small mini-winnie as he chased me with a knife... My dog would come out from under the table (she was a rescue who had been abused) and would trip him up, letting me escape, and he'd hold her hostage-- letting me spend most of the night in the cold, out in the boondocks where it was common for truckers to come through and cougars to attack farm animals and pets. If he felt sober enough, he would chase me down the road for a few hundred yards, and I would walk the three miles into town and wait in the park by the police station until I was sure he'd passed out...",3

"Hi everyone... I am a 19f and I have been depressed and anxious since I was around 13. I also have OCD and ADHD. My life has been pretty fucking shit the last year and half or so like everyone else, but the last month in particular has just been throwing one punch after another at me. I have been suicidal in the past, but nothing like this. Despite being in therapy and finally deciding to try meds again (tried 3 different ones at 15 and all made me worse but I am trying another out of desperation), I have never been this close to actually attempting to harm myself. Point is, I know I need help. Badly. What I am doing now is not enough. So naturally I thought I might benefit from staying in a mental hospital. But I have heard and read such incredibly mixed reviews on whether it is actually harmful or helpful. I am in Massachusetts, USA if that helps anyone have an idea of the type of care around me. But I am worried about being disconnected from the world for an unknown amount of time especially while I am trying to get a job. I am also gluten free for health reasons (but not allergic) and have a lot of stomach issues (I am low fodmap and acid too) and I am worried about being able to have half decent food that works with my restrictions. I do not know what they would confiscate from me there so that I can know what to leave at home. I also do not know what I can bring for comfort like my own pillow and blankets? I do not know how much privacy I will get. Things like that. I have done some research, but cannot find much in depth.If anyone could share their experiences especially if they went to one in MA I would be incredibly grateful. Because having to make this decision with very little idea of how it would actually pan out is just bringing up more anxiety for me which I really do not need. Not sure if I should admit myself to a mental hospital or not (TW)",1

"I honestly just feel empty, unaccomplished, and tired of even thinking about others and things that have it better than i do. I do not want to hear appreciate what you have i do, but i still just feel like nothing. Sometimes i want to break down and cry but i cannot even do that because i just feel nothing. I have lost so many people in my life that were important, it hurts everyday and people close to me just cannot understand. There use to be people like that, but now they are dead too i do not even feel like my own girl feels me why are you sad?

"Stomach issues I currently have some stomach issues that's making my HA flare up.

&amp;#x200B;

It started 3 weeks ago when i felt nauseus after eating lunch, i then focused on this and started googling (bad idea) Then i started feeling bloated after eating and i was having early satiety, belching/burping and nausea. I had good and bad days but was mostly afraid of stomach cancer... however, after reading cancer statistics (only one person between 30 and 35 got stomach cancer last year here in Norway) I no longer have this concern. But the problems are still here.  I went to the doctor on friday, he said it was reflux because of a weak muscle in my stomach and put me on Nexium 20mg for 4 weeks, so that my esophagus would heal.. I took this medication for two days and have stopped because of bad side effects (i got very bad nausea and diarrhea and stomach pain) 

&amp;#x200B;

I still have the following symptoms: Bloating and gas in stomach after eating, nausea and no appetite. I have lost some weight, but i have not eaten as much as i usually do. Is this Anxiety playing its tricks on me? Has anyone had similar experiences? ",2

"Does anyone else have EXTREME guilt? I can’t lie. If I even try I feel like I will explode and I have to immediately tell the truth. Like yeah, not a bad thing to tell the truth but the extreme feeling is also not good. 

My current example is my buying something as simple as a buying something online. I ended up not wanting it and it was a non refundable, non returnable item. So I receive it and it doesn’t work how I want it (nor look how I want it) so I email the company saying it didn’t work properly. They send me a refund and I was like okay all is fine. BUT then I try the item again “just to make sure” it didn’t work… it worked. So I’m guilty for lying even though I didn’t think I was.

"Just so scary. So, I’ve had health anxiety for most of my life. Like over 30 years. I am a nurse. It was easy to go into healthcare because Id spent so much of my life researching different diseases I was sure I had, or thought I had a good chance of getting, or someone I knew I had. I used to really obsessively research stuff, it somehow made me feel better. Anyway. Now, I’m a nurse. I just finished a 4 day stretch of shifts (14 hours a day, no time for meal breaks or any rest at all during work) and I only had time to sleep about 6 hours between shifts. So, I know rationally that my body and mind are exhausted and that exacerbates the health anxiety. But I woke this morning and every single muscle in my legs and back hurt so bad I can hardly walk. My hands are clammy and cold and sweaty (this never happens). I keep swinging between feeling really hot and then getting really chilled. I also have severe emetophobia and I’m terrified I’m coming down with something. My tummy feels weird like I need to poop but I can’t. I can’t stand the thought of food. My throat hurts. And all of this is setting off major panic attacks so bad I feel like I can’t leave my house. (I have a therapy appt in an hour and I really really need to go grocery shopping). Please help.

"Advice? Life's become quite hard worrying about heart attacks I'm 19, 6'1 and about 75kg. I've drank loads of energy drinks in my life and I'm a bit lethargic, I don't do anything deliberately to exercise. But I'm not fat and I don't eat too badly and whatever. No family history of heart attacks at all that I know of, just a lot of cancer. But the past 5 months, literally every day I worry I'm having a heart attack. Whenever I get a bit of chest pain I sieze up and think ""Right, this is it"". And I was never a worrier before this, I'm a really confident person, don't mind getting up on a stage at all. Yet I spend a lot of my days worried shitless about heart attacks now. I went to hospital a few months ago and had a lot of tests done and they said they'd found nothing wrong with me. I had an ECG (I think it's called EKG in America?), blood test, chest x-ray, ultrasound in my belly, obviously the doc checked me out with a stethoscope, and they couldn't find anything wrong. Yet the worry didn't go away. Over Christmas it got really bad, I got scared just walking down the stairs thinking it'd kill me. I do get chest pain and I do think it's real and probably happens worse/more frequently to me than most people, but it's probably just indigestion or something, right? I do eat quite a lot of spicy food and I like fizzy drinks. I don't worry much about other things like cancer, I don't worry about them as much as I should. I just worry about heart attacks and suddenly dying. I always feel uncomfortable in my torso and I'm not sure if there's something wrong the doctors haven't found or if if's purely anxiety. I'm not prone to heart conditions or to anxiety, which came first? Which one is real? I feel a pain in my chest and I get a shooting pain down my left arm fairly often, isn't it natural for me to worry about that? I might have a heart condition that's only detectable when I move around and walk and get the heart going a bit more.

Dunno why I worry about silly shit I can't control. All I know is I have to walk 20 minutes to class this morning and I know the whole time I'm gunna be having mini panic attacks thinking any second I'm going to die. I'm not going to die, right?

Tl;dr I'm not at risk of heart attack but I worry about it a lot because I get a lot of chest pain. Doctors can't find anything wrong with me. I'm not usually an anxious person but I worry about this more than I probably should. How do I cope? What's wrong with me?",2

I’m rather thin and they’re not terribly noticeable but if I feel around it’s maybe a little smaller than the size of my thumb.

"Unfortunately in the great you.S. of A., one needs a solid job with benefits to be able to take off one day, or even one morning, in order to see a doctor. These jobs are getting harder and harder to come by, even if you are fortunate enough to have a bachelors or masters degree. For those who are simply unable to afford the time or money it takes for one day off to see doctors, what do those of us who have that ability have to offer as advice? Or what has helped those reading who do not have the abilities to seek professional help? Say someone is dealing with severe PTSD, depression, anxiety, no longer has a will to live, or make connections with people. The typical response is therapy and doctors, but many people just simply do not have access. TLDR; When you do not have access to mental health help, what do you do? What advice do YOU have that could help someone (ASIDE from doctors, therapy, psychiatrist)? cannot afford to see a therapist or psychiatrist",1
"So all of this began like a month ago. I was in the process of getting out of a depressed situation and was finally getting better. However right as this was happening a chain of terrible misfortunes started happening to me. First I broke my finger and almost poisoned myself in the same day. I am like whatever, shit day but it happens right? So a few days pass and I had pretty much fixed my mood from the shit day and I realized something was wrong with me (it is kind of private so I will not go in detail) but I googled it and it turns out it is a cancer syndrome. I instantly talked to a doctor but he said it I would have to wait a while for him to be available. So I spend the next 2 weeks torturing myself mentally imagining the worst case scenarios to a point where i prepared a knife to off myself if I was diagnosed with cancer. I went to the doctor a few days ago and the test results should be out tomorrow. I was once again starting to feel better and convincing myself that it is going to be alright when just a few hours ago I fell and broke my foot. Why are all of these bad things happening to me? Why are they all happening in such a short amount of time? I am laying on my bed in horrible pain and worrying about my foot, and tomorrow I could be diagnosed with a life threatening disease. If the test results are fine I would probably get in a car crash or something. I cannot take it anymore. When I try to tell my friends about my problems they reply with ""Sucks I guess"" or something like that, my parents do not care either. I am lonely and going thru the hardest time of my life. Everytime I start to get happy something terrible happens and I am thinking of ending it all.",1
"Its my birthday today. I am 29 now. I got up early, took a shower, and played some feel-good music. I did my nails, picked out an outfit, put on my makeup and even did my hair.

The fact that I cannot even feel good on my own birthday makes me feel like a failure. Logically, I know I am not. Logically, I know shit happens. Logically, I know there will be better days. But I do not get to choose when my brain believes logic or not. So today, I am hurting really bad. All I can think about, is wishing that I did not have to be here or feel this anymore. I will not act on those feelings, but it does not change the fact that they are stuck swimming in my head and hurting the hell out of me right now. I just need to get these words out somewhere safe.

"Had a really bad turn the last few days Hi everyone, I've had anxiety for the last 6 months or so in varying levels. From January I was in a decent headspace with it but the last three weeks it's got worse and then the last four days or so it's gone off a cliff. 

It's all I think about all day long, I had panic attacks on Monday and Wednesday and my heart is racing all day. Where before I'd wake up rested now I wake up with my heart racing and frequently my muscles are spasming which is scary. The thought of doing normal stuff feels impossible and I can't shake this feeling I can't get better than this ever again. 

I spoke to my doctor on Thursday and he prescribed propranolol which I took yesterday for the first time which helped with the body stuff but my mind was still racing.

Has anyone experienced similar and have any tips? I feel like this is really really bad and worse than most people have anxiety.",2

"I need support or encouragement. I (29M) really do not know what I am looking for here other than I have nowhere to release the negative energy actively drowning my brain. I am so lost. Heartbroken. Exhausted.I have been in therapy for years and I struggle with major depression, PTSD, and ADHD. I was left a lone a lot as a child and raised by two alcoholics. My Father abused me. I am what you might consider to be a hyper-vigilant overachiever in my family. I create structure in my life to feed my need for validation from others and self-worth (stable house, job, kids). I am Married (Wife is 30F) and we are really struggling. I spent the last ten years working to leave the toxic relationship with my Father. My wife is not an emotional person and I have put my needs on hold for the last four years. We have a daughter (2 years old) and when she was born my wife went through Postpartum Depression and was hospitalized 3 times in 6 months. We struggled to conceive before that and it just feels like we barely know each other anymore, despite trying to make it work and doing the best to keep the ship afloat.I have struggled with suicidal ideation since childhood, and things turned really sour last year when I actively planned to die. I was working from home for nearly a year and could not take the isolation of being at home all day alone. I was actively seeing a therapist, taking meds, and doing everything in my power to keep things balanced. But I just could not do it. I ended up checking myself into the hospital and stayed in a psych ward for two weeks. When I was released I caught COVID and was back in bed for another two weeks. I ended up being out of work for two months by doctors order for mental health issues.Now, the last six/seven months have been up and down, but do include a lot of positive steps forward. I changed therapists and was referred to someone who specializes in co-occurring disorders and trauma. We did a lot of EMDR and that seemed to relieve my nightmares and panic attacks/flashbacks. we have done a lot of CBT as well and our therapeutic relationship is good... I guess? (I will come back to that point). I have worked with a lot of therapists and quite honestly she is the most qualified person I have ever worked with I am going to (or maybe the best fit, given the progress I have made).that is a bit of my background. At this moment I am feeling really discouraged and frustrated with my life and health. there is so much ""good"" around me and on the surface everything should be fine, but I feel like I am dying inside again, and again, and again. I have had a strong stretch of progress over the last three months. I even lost 13 pounds and started eating decent foods again. I journal, meditate, and attend support groups.What I am struggling right now with, speaking honestly, is the lack of affection in my marriage. As I said before, I have been on auto-pilot just trying to keep things afloat the last 4 years. My wife had a surgery, had PPD, we had a baby. I love her dearly, but we are so lost at sea right now. I carry the emotional weight of the marriage. She is mostly not affectionate and I have to chase her (and I have, so many times) to meet even the smallest emotional connection (like a hug). I am a very emotional person and I am feeling starved of love, if that makes sense. We have very open conversations, and she has started trying to change (as have I to meet her halfway, by being appreciative and available), but I am just so exhausted. And frankly, frustrated. It just does not feel organic (it feels forced). She can also be very controlling (OCPD, if you know what that is) and I find myself fighting the urge to do things her way simply for validation. it is a real cluster f&amp;\*k.Back to the therapeutic relationship I have (we will call her T). I was referred to her upon leaving the hospital last December. And I am going to be honest here, because it matters, I crushed on her almost immediately. Despite knowing little to nothing about her (which is a very important boundary), our personalities just clicked. I think that is a big part of why I have been able to make some progress. Despite our difference in age (she is early 40s), I just see a lot of me in her. We like the same music and are generally emotional creatures (think two enneagram 4s, if you know about enneagram). Two tortured souls. Anyway, I brushed this off (I would never felt this way about a therapist) and just moved a long with the sessions each week for months. Despite ignoring it, I felt that our connection grew stronger and stronger as she showed me what it is like to have someone who cares for you completely. This turned into a hot case of transference (read up on that one) driven by the disconnect I have at home with my wife. I fell madly in love with T (or whatever that one-sided relationship is).Now, I eventually told T about how I was feeling. Not to expect anything, but because I really want to recover and did not want it to hinder my progress. I wanted therapy to be about my healing and not about her. She was grateful, caring, and we processed a lot with that (about my childhood, abandonment, etc). I even began to detach (from thinking about her) and feel more self-confident. Things started feeling more balanced at home and at work. I was proud of myself. But something was still missing.Last weekend I just became so overwhelmed with sadness. Like the deep deep deep sadness of an unrequited love. It had not been on my mind for while, but then all the sudden it was. I could not sleep. My nightmares came back. I could not cry and I have become so emotionally numb. it is excruciating. I have put a lot of work in to make my days busy and fruitful, but whenever I go to bed I feel like I am surrounded by vulnerability. I feel so f\*\*ing vulnerable. I am exhausted and frustrated with my life. I am happy that I can get this level of care and support in therapy, which is changing my confidence. But at the same time my marriage is so hollow and lost at sea. We are very caring and dedicated parents (my wife and I), but it is just very much a black and white routine. And I am exhausted from trying to be that emotional plug in our relationship that carries the bag all the time. it is great that she is trying now, but I feel so frustrated with it as well (kind of like I feel that it is not genuine).Couples therapy or marriage counseling is a must at this point, but my Wife avoids therapy and generally views it as unable to help her. I have pushed in the past to start marriage counseling and it always results in her shutting me out (this happens frequently with other things). she will change the way she treats me for a few weeks then goes back to being unavailable and obsessed with work. She is a medical professional and frequently martyrs herself by never taking time off or covering for her co-workers all the time, etc. Her job and career are amazing and I could never do what she does. And I have told her that. I do my best to listen but much of the time she comes home drained and goes right to sleep after we spend some time with our daughter. She deals with intense anxiety and goes through phases of constantly trying to make things more efficient to feed a need for control. it is exhausting, despite my best efforts to understand her and accept it. She refuses therapy (individual sessions for her) and frequently cancels or pushes the subject away. She views her stoicism as strength (which it is) but does not mind that she is wrecked from work 24/7. I often feel like I am married to the medical center and I am her therapist. And it is exceedingly hard to have an equivalent conversation about my job (corporate) where she will listen actively. I have planned nearly all of our family vacations the last 7 years and she has found something wrong with each of them and never wants to go back or enjoy it in the moment. I am frustrated, like I am taken for granted.So how have I handled this? I guess I am projecting all of this onto my therapist. T has my back and we have worked on SO many new skills and tools that have created a foundation for my future growth. she is the right fit for me as a therapist (just by progress alone), but the transference is so hard to process right now. Right now she is probably the only person who is ever accepted me for who I am completely and does not abandon me. And I love her for it. And I cannot break the feelings, despite my best effort to tell myself it is not real. For all intensive purposes the relationship is artificial and one-sided, but it feels so real to me. And it breaks my heart because I will never really have her in my life. Let me rephrase that, it breaks my heart because I feel stuck and unhappy in my marriage for going on 6 years. I feel used and unappreciated at home. My daughter is my world and I am working hard to break the generational cycle of abuse in my family. I am a good, loving father and a loving husband. But I feel so incredibly unhappy, especially all of the sudden.I do not want to quit on my life, but as with my past the pain can become very unbearable. I cannot keep spending my nights alone, on the couch, or out driving a lone just to get some air. I want to feel loved so badly. I am trying to love myself. that is hard. But I am really frustrated with constantly having these cycles of progress then hitting a depressive episode. I cannot tell if it is me or the world I am living in that is the problem. I am a gentle, caring man, who wants the best and I am trying so hard to do all the right things. But I cannot live like this. I am dying inside and it is making me shrewd and aggravated with the world around me. I am fighting the urge to end things and end my pain. I am fighting to not abandon my daughter. But I feel like I cannot do this anymore. I am self sabotaging (taking a break from sessions). I messaged T with what was going on, and gave more clarity on the transference. She was grateful, professional and offered to get some extra sessions in. But the processing is exhausting (examining my childhood) and I have been at it intensively for months. I am so tired and so heartbroken. I asked her to take a break for a month or two (avoidance) because I feel like I am digging inside the pandora's box of my soul each week.I do not want to find another T and I really (REALLY) do not want to start over again. I just feel so discouraged and I feel stuck. And I feel worthless, because the only genuine care I am finding beyond my two year old daughter is in this invisible relationship I have with a stranger. And while that is boosting my confidence, it is also validating the lack of care and support I have outside of the 4 walls of the therapy room. I do not know what to do, but I am trying to not hurt myself. I just wish my brain would shut off for once so I could finally rest.That was a lot and all over the place, so thanks for reading.

"I've been struggling to work/be employed ever since my first job gave me anxiety 6 years ago but I feel like only now I've finally cracked it. In December I managed to work on a contract full time in an office for 6 weeks with only 1 massive panic attack. But now, I'm about to have 3 part time jobs. They're not the sort of jobs I would love to have \(I kind of want a job where I can talk to other people in the workplace\) but I found that social media/community manager gigs are so flexible and are working at home jobs. So I stay anxiety free by setting my own hours and being in control, and I make more money than I would have if I worked at a cafe or at a restaurant.",0

"Random Twitching / ALS Fears I was hoping to find some relief here. About 5 months ago I had some bad panic attacks, with high blood pressure, likely due to high stress. Same deal, thinking I had heart issues. I've been on the generic version of Buspar and a blood pressure medication since then. Things seems ok, until I started to have panic attacks again. A friend told me he had twitching issues with the Buspar, so I'm hoping maybe thats it. 

For the last 3-4 weeks I have been having all sorts of weird twitches EVERYWHERE.  Mostly been in the bridge of my nose, but also in my back, head, arms, neck, abdomen, legs, knees, elbow, and butt. It's very random just a small twitch here and there, and there seems to be no pattern to it. They usually will last a couple seconds. I've been having bad anxiety and stress lately. My wife and I had a baby recently and when I got back to work from my leave, a bunch of people were laid off. A week into being back at work I started having bad panic attacks, chest pain, reflux, I started to get spasms in my esophagus, and trouble breathing, which made me think I was having a heart attack. I then started obsessing thinking I had a heart condition. I got checked out by the doctor and some blood work done and everything checked out ok. I was relieved to hear that things were fine. My doctor switched out my blood pressure medication, but then I started getting muscle twitches all over. Thinking it was because the medication, I went back to my old BP medicine, but after being off of it for over a week, it's still happening My family has a history of ALS, seems to happen later in life, 60+, but when I googled muscle twitching, my anxiety completely went off the rails. The twitching seems less severe, but it's still happening.

I went back to the doctor do more blood work, check for an electrolyte imbalance. I should have the results back at the end of the week. I started CBT last week with a therapist, but the unknown leaves me constantly fearing the worst, and I'm finding it hard to find relief. I haven't been sleeping well because of the baby which could be contributing to the problem. 

Has anyone else had issues with muscle twitching following panic attacks?",2

"Why can’t I be above average at 1 (one) thing? (cw:mentions of ED)

My grades are average. At school I was better than others at languages and took part in olympiads, but now that I’m in uni, I just suck at everything. You can tell me grades don’t mean shit and how some smart and talented people didn’t do well in terms of academic performance.

So what? I’m not one of them by any means. I’m not good at scientific research in my field, either. They say, some people naturally think like scientists. They ask the right questions, challenge ideas without taking them for granted etc. I’m not capable of that.

I’ve had an ED which allowed me to have an extremely low BMI so for some time I felt like I’m better than others at least at something. I was dumb enough to try recovery and now I’m technically not even underweight.

I had hobbies like chess and drawing but I don’t have enough motivation to do them regularly, and anyway it would probably take years for me to become just ""good"" at it.

There are no other areas in my life where I could better than average. This is it. You could tell me being above average should not be that important anyway. It’s totally fine if it’s not for others, but for me it would mean a lot. I would feel like my existence isn’t absolutely pointless. I can’t just live and try to enjoy stuff.

"I despise living with my family but I can't afford to move out. I've been trying to move out for years but I make jack shit for my job. 

Every. Single. Day. When I get home there's an issue. It is always my older sister 100%.

"Is it anxiety and over thinking? Or is it intuition? How to know the difference? My partner has lied to me in the past and now anything that is remotely close to that topic makes me think he’s lying. And then I spiral and think I have to check his phone, then I think he deleted messages, then I need to check his Apple Watch, and then I think he may have used another form of contact and I start to feel like maybe I’m being illogical and crossing the line. In the moment, I feel like nothing can give me relief except for finding solid “proof.” 

I’m not proud of this behavior. I recently started therapy for my overall anxiety. Unfortunately it is hard to afford to have sessions often enough. 

Context: 
He lied 1.5 years ago about something relating to a female coworker it was not infidelity. After lying, he was able to “prove” he was telling the truth. I feel 99% confident about it. Since then, he lied about about small things like not playing video games while on the phone. Idk I don’t want to damage my relationship with this but I also don’t want to be lied to again and turn a blind eye. 


So how can I know if I am acting because of anxiety and overthinking opposed to following intuition and following my gut. My intuition is how I caught his initial lie.",2

"I got extremely stressed in workplace and home. To speak I live in South East Asia, where work is long hours and pay is only enough to try to survive a month.

I have been managing my stress with family issues too so everything is a bit of a mishmash as I am angrily typing this down. And autism doesn't help with my stress management either.

I had been working in a shitty workplace. The pay ain't bad but to deal with my boss terrible management and temperament which makes his employee turnover rate is so high .People would stay around for a week up to 3-4 months, with the group chat kept having people leave and join. As of now there are around 15 people who have come and gone which I seen since the first day I joined and worked here up until now. I heard that this business has been running for 4-5 years now but from what I seen is almost like an enterprenuerial business with no idea and direction they wanted to do as they have tutoring, selling board games/blind boxes and even large figurine tradings, throwing menial tasks at every employee with focus on trying to get more employees to join. I worked around 11-12 hours on average so it makes me stressed at first.

Then a few days ago when I got home from work (around 11pm almost midnight) my dad called me in to have a talk with him, then he explains that he's worried about my health and my body health. At first I didn't think about it much. Me and my father didn't go well for a long time so I think of it more as of a warning, however it turned to make me angry and stressed as he simulate what will happen to me by imagining if I were turned into a disabled person and unable to move at all, with me still able to talk. I got so stressed and tired enough that I didn't get enough sleep after I finally got to excuse myself.

And comes up to today as I had enough with today as I tend after their store and I was a little loopy, I looked like I was sleeping when I'm actually trying to stay awake. The owner called me that he's been watching me sleeping for 15 minutes and he's going to cut my pay. Then he ordered me to go to wash my face. i did before coming back, so angry and annoyed that I slapped the store's security camera, HARD. Luckily it didn't break just the camera cable disconnected so it's an easy fix. So I just called the manager and told them that the camera accidentally fell to the ground and broke, saying that it worked fine after I reassembled it. I was a little panicked but a little less stressful from that.

Sorry it's more of a rant post, but I do need help managing my own stress and it just came up almost everyday. How do I do it? I felt like I could explode at any point right now.",3

"My gf and I broke up, my family how my dad just had fucked me up for so long, I have one bestfriend but truthfully I feel like when I am down nobody wants to deal with it. I just feel alone man. For once ya know. I may sound pessimistic but I am stressed. I am 24, in debt, moving out because I cannot be in this house with an abusive dad anymore, no college degree, only one friend who does not feel like he cares as much as he should or feels awkward when I am down so its just me. I have no one to talk to.I feel like everyone hates me. I feel like a loser. I just feel like total shit. People usually have family or at least a family member to be there for them. People usually have lots of friends to care for them when they are down. Me no. I feel like I am socially inept. Like I am too fucked up to be around anyone. Like I am just nothing. I totally feel like I cannot do shit. People act like they care ya know and tell me the most obvious things. Like it will be okay or everything is fine but for me it does not feel like that. For them being okay is just breathing. I just feel empty. I wish I had friends who cared for me who had love. No matter how stupid that sounds because that is all I need. A family that has love. But all around me is just negativity and all these heavy labels and expectations. It destroys me how people think so shitty of me. When everyday I feel like I go out of my way to try. When I believe in my heart that no matter what Ill be there for my friends family and my girlfriend with all my heart forever. And its just not like that. Nobody feels that way for me. No matter how embarassing or sad this sounds its the truth of how I feel. And I feel like total shit. And all I need is love for once. I never got it as a kid. People say at least you have a dad and family. But a dad who abused me my whole life. Who still just talks shit about me. A sister who treats me like total shit. A mom who is so destroyed by an abusive husband who has the best heart but is so hurt she drinks all night every night and cries. A girlfriend who says she cares and loves me but always has to put me down and say she is going to end it. All the friends I had that just ditched me, who was just a friend to be around me or make plans. Where for once is the love. Honestly. When can I finally have somebody there for me through hard times? Even if I am a dick sometimes I am human. I am always there when people treat me like shit. But once I do something wrong its the end of the world. Everyone expects me to be perfect. To have everything done perfectly. Like I am some fucking robot man. No free time just all my time spent to please everyone and work hours on hours to bring money in to give to everyone else too. To just say I have money. To just say I did this and that and I do not give a fuck about money. I do not care to have money to flaunt and just act successful. But that is what everyone expects of me. To be perfect. While I have been just trashed on my whole life. Elementary school being made fun of for being overly energetic and wanting attention because at home I just got the shit beat out of me. Made fun of because I am Japanese. Middle school just made fun of because I am the weird shitty kid who acts stupid because I just want people to like me because nobody fucking does. because I get trashed on by my dad and family and whole school. Being a fucking outcast. Idk man. I feel like total shit. Girlfriend knows how hard my life is now. she is went through it with me but she cares about herself so much. does not see how much pain I feel because I do not show it. because I do not want to cry everyday and whine because everybody has told me to man up and grow up anytime I feel like this. I feel broken man. Feel totally alone, lost, and destroyed",1

"so first i tried prozac which is probably the only anti depressant to work consistently when i was 14-17 . but it stopped working and i fell back into horrible depression and social anxiety . so i tried zoloft it only worked for a few weeks which has left me traumatised seeing how happy i could be then it slipping through my fingers and never returning. then effexor did not do anything , then i tried lexapro and that did nothing , then i tried paxil and that kind of worked but mmm not really . still hated myself . i tried zoloft again and still nothing :/ . is there something wrong with my brain like badly ? so i stopped the meds for a week and tried lsd . it barely had any effects . like i seen barely any visuals and just felt weird. i had 450 ug and my friend friend t and it worked for her . could my serotonin receptors be non existent or something or not work ? i just want to be happy .I am only 19 and i feel like an old lady . i work out often even though its been getting hard to keep up with it lately :/ i feel like everyone around me laughs with their friends and can have fun like a normal person and I am stuck in a cage and watching everyone at a party i was not invited to. I am so alone and i feel like i just do not matter. i suffered abuse as a child but i do not remember it so idk if therapy would help plus i do not open up to anyone . I am not someone who is ever really done drugs but I am considering it . a temporary high sometimes is better then constant emptiness in my option . thanks what do i do next :/ it feels like I have tried everything",1

"Using an old throwaway account. I am 33, located in the US, and I have had anxiety issues for quite a long time. I should have started therapy when I was 18. Recently I have been trending much more towards depression, and I NEED to address it now. My questions are:How do I find a therapist?What is the average cost? I created an account for my insurances website to see my plan and it does not look like they cover it at all.There are different types of therapy? How can I tell what type of therapist to use?I am sure I will think of more but I am having a hard time concentrating. Like I said, anxiety issues up the wazoo. Had them for most of my life but I think it got much worse after a bad salvia trip around 10 years ago, but that is not important. I have an extremely hard time discussing and articulating my emotions. The last few weeks I began having intrusive thoughts about suicide (hello hotline bot, I am safe now but I like that you are here anyway). I have most definitely also lost interest in the things in my life that brought me joy, and the past week my appetite has gotten markedly lower. So yeah, depression. A little over a week ago I had a yearly physical but I guess my answers to their mental health questionnaire did not raise any alarms and I was scared to ask how to go about starting therapy.On to my little rant, at the start of April a coworker invited me out to get drinks and we hit it off amazingly. I am actually one of her supervisors so we had to keep it hush hush at work. Texted constantly for the first few weeks, neither of us had felt that kind of connection to someone else before. Conversation that flowed from one topic to the next, from getting out of work at 5 or 6 until going to bed around 1. We also saw each other outside of work at least every other day. That pace kept up for about a month, maybe got a little slower through May.By June we were seeing each other less and while texting nearly every day we are talking much less, and I feel my apprehension to discussing my feelings is the because. I care deeply about her and I do not want to lose her because I am unable to talk seriously about us. Add to that having to see her at work every day and I am a mess of emotions, which have really boiled over the last couple days. It was my birthday on Saturday and I spent most of it crying in my room, dreading having to respond to the birthday wishes I was receiving. This evening I asked her when I could see her next, and did not get a reply. Four hours later I asked if we could talk and was again met with silence. I am not the type to incessantly send messages hoping to annoy or guilt someone into responding so I left it at that, but in the words of Tom Petty, the waiting is the hardest part. I do not know what exactly I am looking to accomplish with this post. I have a good amount of friends but I do not have a best friend that I can confide in and talk to about things like this. I am just a mess of a human right now, and I think my brain is trying to go in so many directions that I cannot even have a good cry, even though I think that is what I want in this moment.

"I am so damn exhausted of my mind screwing everything up. I am about to turn 30 in a few weeks and although I have been fortunate enough to have had many women interested in me throughout the years, I just cannot seem to hold a stable relationship for longer than a few months. When I was younger it was not a huge deal, but now that I am getting older I am beginning to feel I may never be able to develop a long-lasting meaningful romantic connection with anyone and it makes me feel so deeply alone.The thing is, I am able to clearly see how it is me pushing my partners away. Once the initial excitement wears off, I go back to being aloof, insecure and self-centered and I can sense my masculine essence eroding. I can see how my partners go from being attracted to me to feeling sorry and completely turned off. I do not blame them. I do not want them to carry any of my burdens. I want to own up to them and keep fighting to get better. But with each passing relationship, I just become more afraid of opening up about my mental struggles and having them realize that the confident, fun version of me is kind of a part-time deal.On top of it all, I seem to be developing some kind of body dysmorphia. Depression sure seems to have done a number on me physically and its causing me to age a lot more quickly than my peers. I am rapidly losing my hair, about a third of my beard and body hair is already gray, I have bad eye bags and dark circles and, although I have tried, I just do not look good completely bald and I have been told as much by friends. I legitimately hate looking in the mirror most days. I even started dating older women in hopes that it would even things out, but the same thing happened.My last partner recently left me after I became insecure and started acting weird and it really hurt me because I actually did care about her. But somehow, just a week later, the universe has already put two new women in my life who are showing interest. The thing is, I am seriously afraid of trying this again and screwing it up once more. I do not think my heart can take much more disappointment and I am tired of superficial connections.I know I need to develop self-love and find something to get excited about every time I wake up before I try to find someone again, but the thing is I am also very lost and lack direction in life. The only thing I am truly passionate about is music, and that is just not going to pay the bills or provide me with the financial stability that a relationship requires. Besides that, I am working on finishing a degree in biochemistry (two semesters left), but I have no desire to go to grad school or Med school, and the job prospects with a B.S. in that field look bleak.Are there any guys out there who have managed to be in successful or satisfying relationships in spite of all your struggles? If so, how did you manage? I do not think my depression will ever go away at this point, and I do not want to end up alone or hurting myself and others even further. Thank you for reading.

"Eyelids twitching for many months? Just wondering how many people here have had their eyelids twitching for many months (or longer)?  If you finally got it to go away, what did you do?

I see a lot of posts where people are stressing about eyelids twitches they’ve had for days or weeks (or sometimes hours).  But mine have twitched to varying degrees since last May or so.  I have tried several bouts of destressing, improving my sleep, meditating, exercising, eating bananas, drinking tonic water, taking multivitamins, ... but can’t seem to get them to stop twitching.

I also notice if I blink hard, sneeze, look certain directions, etc that they’ll start twitching.  If I partially close my eyes then the muscles around my eyes quiver like they’re straining to hold the position.  Which leads me down the path of thinking it’s more than stress / anxiety and something more in my muscles or nervous system.  Especially since it has lasted this long, through many periods of low stress.

Any advice from people who have beaten this?  I can’t even remember what it was like to go a whole day without twitching!  ",2

"tw// eating disorder? not sure if it is or if the tw is needed but just in caseI think this will be all over the place as I am still not sure if it makes sense and am just wrapping my head around it, but I will try. Okay, so I always loved eating, it was a big source of comfort and joy ever since I was a kid (20s now). When I was 18 or 19 (when I started college and started spending more time with my peers as I moved into a new city) I started realizing that I might have an unhealthy relationship with food, as I was binge eating on the daily basis and just started seeing that people around me do not consume the food the way I do, like for example they would stop eating when full. By that point I had always just assumed that everyone ate enormous quantities of food and that it is normal for food to play such a crucial role in ones life.I was also and still am heavily depressed throughout all these years and around the time the first lockdowns were happening last year (early 2020) I realized I was getting high so I can eat more/open up my apatite. I know that it probably started way earlier (I started smoking when I was a freshmen in HS) but that is the first time I noticed the direct link. I mostly eat junk food, such as hamburgers, chips, ice cream basically all the crap you can think of. At some point I ate melted chocolate and canned cream for breakfast. I am pretty sure I gained 60 or 65lbs since I left my hometown which then in return directly makes my depression even worse. So I have been feeling like I am trapped in a vicious cycle for a while now.A couple of months ago I started having days, sometimes multiple in a row, where I would not eat at all or crave any food. I would just feel nauseous by the mere thought of eating anything. There are still days when I binge eat but I feel disgusted and nauseous by the food and the act itself while it is happening whereas before I enjoyed it. Even when I am having a regular-sized meal I sometimes feel disgusted. I was walking around the supermarket today and realized I had not eaten anything in 2 days and that I have no cravings whatsoever. So, I do not know where to go from here? Is this a good thing, that I am disgusted by binge eating (I still do it tho)? Is the feeling of nausea coming from the junk food or is this an eating problem or am I just getting older and not being able to eat as much as I used to and the crap I used to? I know the obvious answer is seek professional help but I would like to hear any thoughts or advice that you might have as I am not even sure what is happening.To anyone that has taken their time to read this, thank you I am disgusted by food",1
"I am so fucking depressed. I have nobody to talk to, I am a traumatized mess, I hate myself, I have no fucking worth, I only get validation through others. I am so fucking needy. Like how am I supposed to do anything like learn a hobby? Whenever I face something I do not understand or cannot do well on I just think ""why do not I just kill myself or give up on this anyway"" I have nobody that cares about me. I have a slight interest in maybe TRYING 2-3 things for fun. There are some subreddits related to all of these interests, and even helpful people within them that want to help people. But imagine this as a scenario: you are an artist trying to teach someone about something, and at some point the student/person does not understand something. There are multiple directions this can go. 1. Student does not ask for further clarification for fear of looking stupid/being a burden etc.2. Student asks for further clarification, but does not understand still, feels guilty about burdening people3. Student has a mental breakdown and runs awayHow can you teach someone like that? I do not even remember what happiness feels like.",1

"Two years ago I moved to the US for college. I am 19 now, and I am Arab. I knew moving abroad would come with challenges, but I cannot help but feel like so much of what I think, have to say, even feel in reaction to situations is different from everyone around me. I feel like my emotions are exaggerated, I express them too warmly (not in a good way) compared to other people. I feel like I am amazed and impressed by things others around me do not bat an eye on. I feel like so much of how I feel is extra, overly emotional, not fitting for the situation, like I am overflowing. Its really hard to describe. But its really alienating. I know I am not the first person to move abroad and feel alienated, but I just did not think it would happen in this way. I thought that was things like different cultural norms, language barrier, feeling homesick, etc. that made you feel alienated. But I am internalizing this so much. Feeling like I myself am abnormal.

"Hi everyone and by the way I am sorry if I am making lots of mistakes while writing this because english is not my first language,So i would like to start by describing my current situation a little bit : so I am a 27 year old men, i live in Europe with my parents and i was able to find a full-time job 2 months ago. And as long as i can remember I have always kind of struggled to interact with people in general, and i do not know if i have some kind of ""trauma"" because of that, but basically i could go to wherever place in the world and get the feeling that I am being ""rejected"" and judged by everyone and that I am not really welcome anywhere. Teachers at school always repeated the same things about me : ""he is so quiet"" ""he rarely ever talks"" ""he always seems distracted by he is thoughts when he is in class"" and other things.And it is weird because when i ask my parents about my childhood they are always saying that i was way more sociable than i am now as an adult, but i honestly do not ever remember being that way.Anyways so basically I have never really had a close group of friends and I have never had a girlfriend either, which i really feel depressed (and even suicidal sometimes) about because it makes me feel like I am a failure and I have wasted the ""best"" years of my life and i feel like such a shit and loser almost everyday because of that.And so of course since I am living with parents, my mother in particular is kind of worried about me because she is scared that I will just end up being a loner for my whole life once she and my dad are dead. I have been also worrying about my state for years now, and i honestly do not see any solutions to it. Just thinking about myself as a person disgust me so much, all of that wasted time and all those missed opportunities makes me so suicidal.I am so ashamed of myself for not even being able to interact and talk to people normally without overthinking, overanalizing everything and most of all sabotaging myself with different thoughts. Pretty much all of my thoughts are about sabotaging myself : ""i suck"" ""I am a loser"" ""i should just jump off a bridge or hang myself because I am such a fuking useless and pathetic piece of shit"".And so i kind of just do the ""bare minimum"" i would say to function in society, only interacting at my workplace with coworkers when it is really needed, because i would rather avoid any interaction with anyone at all if that was possible, but unfortunately it is not. When i look into myself i really feel like a robot or an NPC from a video game that is just giving the same responses over and over ""yes"" ""no"" and that is it, nothing more, just trying to make the damn conversation as short as possible because it is so stressful for me to handle.I""m kind of angry at my parents for making so much remarks about me not having friends/gf because i tried multiple times to explain to them what i was going through whenever I am interacting with people... but they just do not understand and i pretty much gave up on trying to explain it to them.And what is even worse is that a lot of people consider me to be a pretty ""handsome"" guy and some of them even assumed that i must have had lots of gf's/hookups in my life, which is not true at all lol. So for me it is even worse because it feels like a lot of my ""potential"" is just completely wasted by this stupid anxiety.Anyways I have made an appointment with another therapist to see if she could help me with this problem, but without sounding too pessimistic i really have very little hope that I am ever going to feel better. Because i think to myself ""I have struggled with this almost my whole life and so how could just talking about it to someone even help me ?""that is pretty much it i guess, i really hope you guys are doing okey and that you are not suffering too much from SA like i do.What do you guys think about all of this ?

Thank God it did not break. Left tacks on the floor when he moved out. This is what is killing me right now. The dress and wool trench I got to wear to my brothers funeral is gone.

"Can't think of a suitable name for this post  

I have been blessed with the ability to freak myself right the F\*$&amp; out whenever i think about a host of different topics... anxiety. Now most of these topics ive been able to find categories for, and address in that way, by learning about those things, bettering my understanding of them, and really evaluating exactly what it is that im afraid of. For example, i am a hypochondriac, i have lived with health anxiety for as long as i can remember, but its very easy to find out what health anxiety is, you can easily find other peoples experiences, common coping mechanisms, potential causes for this anxiety, etc. This is the case with almost anything i find myself consistently anxious about.

Now,

One of the darkest corners in my mind that i try to stay out of as much as possible, is one that i cant get a lot of information on, and because of this, i don't know how to move forward in addressing this.

This anxiety / fear is triggered by thoughts of existence, reality, the thought of consciousness... trying to wrap my mind around what it is that I'm experiencing just by being alive in the first place. A good example thought of this would be this:

Whether you are reading this on a computer or phone or tablet... stop and take a second to think about what is between your eyes reading this, and the screen Infront of you, now i don't mean the air, pollen, dust, particles etc. that occupies that space, but the f#$%ing space itself. How? why is that there? what is that occupying? how did it get there?

I experience symptoms of derealization / depersonalization disorder that I've observed are closely related to my thoughts like this, Hell I believed when I was 17 until 20 I was falling into psychosis due to my relentless obsessing over the unanswerable. Its not even one specific mind-F#$\* that does this to me, it's the combination of all of them that represent what we call ""reality"" or ""existence"" that i cant tune out, and the more i try to research these things in my life, the more questions that are left unanswered. i can barely hold conversations with people because of how often i just go blank, returning to being consumed with mulling these things over, IN THE MIDDLE OF CONVERSATIONS.

I feel like most people are able to just curb these thoughts as ""unimportant"" or just set them aside because there's no way to answer things like that at the moment. Boy do i wish i could do just that. Thoughts like this are 25/8 on my mind, I mean I DREAM about inexplicable things that could never be answered, and i wake up, open my eyes and wonder what is this plane of existence that I'm experiencing? how do i retain my persona, my memories, my trains of thought, all of my experiences after so many years? How do i face any interaction, any experience, any leaf that lands Infront of me on a walk without my mind jumping to the probability of these things happening? And then wondering how I'm even able to question that in the first place?

This has not been a mid-life crisis, rather it has been a whole-life drain. I have never been afraid of the 18 wheeler next to me on the freeway, yet i have always been afraid of the inevitable heat death of the universe. Why am I like this?",2

I first noticed it back in October and got an ultrasound that came back all clear. Basically, my right nipple has been feeling weird. The best way I can describe it, is either burning or if I had applied some vapor rub. It comes and goes I haven’t felt it in 2 months but it came back... has anyone felt this before?

"Anxiety or actually ill? So I don't know where to start this so I'm just gonna get to the point. I'm an otherwise healthy 20 y/o female and last week my legs started feeling very itchy. Then, the itching moved upwards to my torso and arms. On wednesday I noticed two strange rashes on my arms and decided to see a doctor because the itching was just horrible. He said it's probably an allergy and that he can't do much until i figure out at least if it's food or something enviromental causing the problem, and he gave me allergy pills to ease my itching and rashes. He said to take two if the rashes reappear. So the next day, when I got another one on my arm, I took just one pill, and they stopped appearing. The next day, I took one more just to be sure and the itching and rashes were totally gone by friday. Now, the problem is, on friday I thought my breathing was a bit more labored than usual. It's probably all in my brain but the feeling hasn't gone away. If I put my mind to something else, I'm fine, but as soon as I start thinking about it, I get panicky. It's been the same for 4 days now, and I'm not sure what to do about it. Also, on friday, when I had lunch I ate very little until I started feeling very sick. The same on saturday and sunday. Is it all due to my anxiety? I'm nervous to see a doctor because I don't want him to think I'm making stuff up, because I was just at his office a few days ago, and now I'd show up with another problem. Helppp",2
"I don’t know who I am anymore I’ve always been known for my kindness and empathy and, in my opinion, that was the only thing good about me but lately I’ve been rude sometimes and making “jokes” who hurt other people without thinking about it. My intention never was hurting them but I say what comes to my mind without thinking how it would affect others. As a sensitive person, I feel like a piece of shit because I would not like if the things I say were redirected to me (that’s I know they are rude). I’m afraid I’m turning into a horrible person because I’m losing my common sense and it’s making me conscious because the moment I realize I did that I feel the worst person on earth. I want to be a kind person again",1

"19f low heart rate So I have a lot of anxiety about my heart rate. it has always been about it being too high, I'm always freaking out over high heart rate. never once did it occur to me that it could be too low, because that was never a problem for me. a few weeks ago I was sitting down listening to music with friends. I looked at my fitbit (which I constantly check for accuracy and it is usually a max of 3 beats off) and my heart rate was 54. I got up and I felt super heavy and drained and had zero energy, but I forced myself to walk around and stand up for a while to increase my heart rate. I am diagnosed with Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Disorder. usually when I stand up my heart rate shoots up a fair bit. But I was walking around and standing up and it only went to 56. so I forced myself to skip around. I barely could, I felt super heavy and all I wanted to do was submit to gravity and collapse. that made my heart rate go to 57. it took about half an hour to get to an okay place at 72 bpm sitting down.

then last night, I laid down in bed and my bpm immediately sunk down to 52. I was up for three hours laying in bed bc I couldn't fall asleep over anxiety over my heart rate. I checked it on my fitbit and manually constantly and it was often hovering between 47 and 50. laying in bed typing this now after having stood up for a while it's 59.

i am a 19 year old girl, 120 lbs. during the summer I'm moderately active but during the winter I am pretty darn sedentary. I booked an appt with my cardiologist, but that's for a few days yet. every time I started to fall asleep last night my mind jerked me back, convinced I was either passing out or dying. it's gonna be a anxious and sleepless few days.

"Hi, redditors. First time posting. Dunno where else to put this.Little background: I am a fit, healthy (mostly) M23 with a history of chronic and sometimes severe depression and frequent (daily) suicidal thoughts with a couple minor attempts some years ago... I am not on any meds but am contemplating taking them lately.My story of my sad summer (so far)This year started off pretty good, finally moved out for the first time last year and have been fairly happy. Have had no luck with the girls I like, even though I am apparently quite handsome. They just lose interest after a while and I have sort of given up on asking any out. Have moved into an apt. more recently with a longtime best friend from HS, which has been decent enough but we are drifting apart because of typical roommate shit. I have accepted it and I am okay with it, I think I would be fine without them in my life after this year. I do not have many friends otherwise though, and the new people I meet are mostly temporary friends. COVID restrictions in my city have also made it tough, particularly because I have not seen most of my extended family in over a year.Other than that I was having my hours gouged at work for a job and company I already hated, they cut me down to 12ish hours a week before I had enough. I would had a few thousand dollars saved so decided to quit. it is been fine since then, but money does not last forever and I do not have enough to support me for long. it is been a month with a little labor work on the side and I am nearly broke again. I was partying too much this summer in general so that does not help my money problem, going to the beach and drinking almost every day... doing coke all night with all kinds of people. From strippers to eccentric youths I have met at said beach. Gradually I began to feel I had a problem, tried to cut back and failed, every time I drink I just lose all inhibition. Finally quit for maybe a couple weeks and stayed sober, was tough but I am alive. Looking for a new job still, maybe not looking as hard as I should, then I get some bad news about my cousin, that is also my age and in the same city, who was partying (like me) and OD'd on drugs I have done before and nearly (or maybe lowkey did) OD'd on too... He was braindead and in hospital for a few days. Then another friend from HS few days later same thing. They died one day and the next. That was a week and a half ago, I broke my sober streak pretty fast. I never tell my parents this kind of shit and it hurts talking about my cousin and friend even more, especially when they say some dumb shit like how they were stupid for what they did etc... I have lost 3 friends my age to drug overdoses this year now and I think it is all just hitting me at once like the cars of a trainwreck smashing into one another and unable to stop.On the upside my best friend's birthday was this last week, though I almost did not want to go but convinced myself to so I could have a good time, and while on a raging bender I went with them and friends to another city to party. I think I drank almost constantly from breakfast to bed for at least 5 days straight and hardly ate a meal a day... It was a good experience all things considered, I made a lot of good memories in Montreal... that entire day and night of my friend's bday in particular was like an indie film... but I do not know if I have ever gone that hard in my life and it scares me in hindsight. I was doing a few different drugs with those friends on the birthday as well, literally all day, and disappeared with half of the drugs to go bar hopping when they did not want to go out of the air BnB we were staying in. They were not happy, and I did not have a working phone for them to call me on... or any of their phone numbers.That night was great but the day after... that hangover was the scariest I have ever had, and the day before we would all left to Mtl I broke my phone after getting home with a stockpile of booze so could not call anyone. I was pretty sure I would suffer a heart attack if I got up off my couch and decidedly stayed put for the entire first day and night I was back. My heart was POUNDING from the withdrawals as I would probably taken enough alcohol and coke / molly for three people. I think part of me wanted to die, though I do not think I would have as I am a fit 23 year old male but... I was pretty sure I would be the next of my friends to overdose that day. I like to think this has been transformative, but I am still drinking and I think I have a long way to go to get out of this rut I have dug myself into... but I have been here before. I tell myself I will not commit suicide, even if it feels like it would solve all my problems and set me free, because I do not want to hurt my family and friends. I feel I owe them all my life, hopefully a good life. I still think of jumping from my balcony every day though.Going to see my cousin's grave tomorrow and say goodbye finally. Lots of family will be there and I will be sober. it is going to be thunder showers all day so I got an umbrella. I think it is fitting. Maybe the hard rain will wash the tears from my face and the stains from my soul. I have been crying more these past weeks than I have through my entire adult life and I am ready for it to stop. I am not religious either, I still consider myself an atheist (not so sure lately) but I have prayed to ""god"" and asked to let me bear the burden of my family's grief so theirs might be lessened. Among other things. So I think this pain will never go away and I will just try to be strong for them and myself instead. I am not sure what I want from this post except to write about it and get it off my chest. it is been keeping me up tonight. Maybe I will start writing poetry again.So thank you for reading, if you did. I hope all of you out there stay well, there is beauty and meaning out there if you look for it. I have been finding much of it lately, just do not expect it to fall into your lap. Go out and find it. there is all kinds of wonderful things out there just waiting for someone to stand witness. My Summer of Sadness",1
It feels like my middle chest is tight. My heart feels like it is beating too fast. Sometimes it feels like it is hard to breathe. My eyes get really watery and it is hard to cry. Some days it feels like I just want to rip my chest open to make it stop. The first time it happened i was in dance class. I had that tight feeling in my chest and I just started crying I did not know what was wrong. After that I quit. I started losing interest in things I loved. Sometimes I would not even go to school and I started acting up. I would always be angry and that resulted in me and my mom having rocky relationship. She would ask me what is wrong with me I just would not know what to say. My freshman year I started seeing therapist. They wanted to give me medicine but my mom got upset and told them no. I am 18 now and I am tired of having this feeling. I have been trying to focus on getting my driver's license but it just feels like this a dark force is consuming my body. I cannot keep living like this. Can you feel your depression,1

"Got pulled over by police and got my first ticket I (23) F have never been pulled over or given a traffic ticket. Ive been having a horrible day so far as my abusive ex has tried reaching out to me this morning and i have just been super anxious and feeling bad about myself so i decided to do some chores and head to the gym. 
While driving there i thought i could make this yellow light and ended up running through a red light and a cop was conveniently there to see and pull me over. I was so scared and on the verge of tears the whole interaction and he ended up giving me a ticket. 
Instead of going to the gym i just drove home crying thinking of how much of a piece of shit i am and now i’m currently sitting in my driveway crying and overwhelmed. 
I just wanted to go and try to make today a good day by going to the gym and cleaning the house and now i feel even more overwhelmed and depressed and anxious and stressed and i just want to crawl into a hole and die right now.

"Does anyone else worry about early-onset dementia? Firstly - I lurk here from time to time and I don't see this come up very often, so I'm sorry if this gives anyone yet more to worry about. Feel free to stop reading now!

I don't know how this has got into my head, but you know how these things can suddenly take hold, right? You read something by mistake, or someone tells you something you didn't want to hear about how this guy got diagnosed with Alzheimer's in his 30s or whatever, and suddenly it's occupying your every waking moment. These ideas have taken root in my mind and I can't make them go away.

I've been under a lot of stress at work for a long time. I'm responsible for the finances in a company which has been teetering on the edge of bankruptcy for several years, and in September I had my first ever panic attack over worries that we wouldn't be able to make payroll. I know intellectually that the symptoms I'm experiencing can rationally be explained by this, but still. I can't stop thinking about it. I've felt over the past few months that I can't think or write as fluently as I could. I make more mistakes. I feel scatterbrained and foggy, and I struggle to concentrate. I feel like it takes me longer to do things that should be much easier than I'm finding them.

It's led me to start compulsively and repeatedly testing myself on things I ""should"" know, which of course makes the anxiety and racing thoughts worse. Can't instantly recall all my PINs and passwords? Dementia. Can't find the right word while I'm talking? Dementia. Repeat myself while I'm typing a sentence? Dementia. Can't remember who starred in that film I saw last week? Dementia. Can't remember every detail of my journey to work? Dementia. It's taken me ages to write this. Dementia.

Flash forward a few years, and I see myself sat in a chair unable to recognise my family :-(. It's horrible.

I just wanted to get this out. I know there are a lot of people in this sub who will have fellow feeling. Hope you're all doing OK.",2

But then as I got older things went downhill from there. did not get many friends in middle school. Got bullied many times and made fun of. Middle school was definitely one of the worst in my lifetime. My family made even worse on me. Mom, Dad, Brother almost everybody. Got called a fatty by my father and mother many times. Got called a fat cow by my brother. Got called a fucking idiot by my parents. Yeah that is cool. But what do they do to my brother? Nothing. Literally nothing. Hes my opposite of what I am. I am his shadow. Sometimes I feel like I am drowning in my own tears and my hurts every time I try to breathe. I even feel like my tias and tios like my brother and my other cousins more than me. I am just a piece of garbage left out on the counter. Everyday I wake up disappointed knowing I am going to have to live and see the same faces and words. Do I have depression? Idk at this point.

"Being bad at something new gives me anxiety I know it’s contradictory but yeah. Not sure if this has to do with being a perfectionist or if it’s something else.

It’s like I just want to skip to the “good” part. I feel like the work is only productive/useful when it’s good.

How do you even deal with the uncomfortable parts of learning and growing? :( 

I just keep pushing on but sometimes it feels like I’m making no progress at all. And I know that “slow progress is still progress” but then my anxiety kicks in with bullsh*t like “other people are staying up and working their asses off while you’re celebrating a tiny step forward.”",2

I cannot see an actual therapist right now for a variety of reasons (namely, those reasons are ""too poor and too American to afford it"" and ""my family would flip the absolute fuck out"")I wish someone would have told me how quickly your teeth begin to rot from even just short periods of being too miserable to brush them. Or how common overeating (or undereating in other people) is and gave me specific ways to manage it before I gained so much weight. Or how all it takes is the absolute *smallest* inconvenience to put you on the verge of a breakdown. The other day I almost screamed in public over my earbuds having dead batteries! Or how depression's not even 100% emotional - the worst symptom for me at this point is not even the sadness, it is the constant blankness in my mind and inability to focus. Or how, after long enough, depression begins to *physically* show as well. I have dark circles that never go away and permanently bloodshot eyes. People ask if I am sleep deprived all the time regardless of how long I slept.Bleh. Sorry for the long and probably incoherent rant. But yeah. Next time I read some unhelpful, non-specific ""channel your emotions into something positive"" (without even telling you how to do that!) I am going to explode. I hate how vague and useless all the resources online are. (long-ish)",1

"I luckily rarely feel bad depression, tonight is one of those times. This post is just to write it out of myself.I feel like I am in a battle with my own thoughts and emotions. Right now I feel alone even though I have people who support me. I do not want to give in to depression, but I also do not have life goals, motivation or really anything that excites me. I do not have a bad life, but I do not have anything going on now (no job, no healthy hobbies, no meeting with people). I was not fully okay when I still attended school either which makes me worried/scared that this feeling will come back even when I will finally have a job that occupies my mind.I am stressed about having to juggle and fix so many things in my life at once: work, friendships, house chores, anxiety, depression, hobbies, habits, therapist... it is too much, and it feels like I am going nowhere. It feels like that even though I try to be better, get better, it works only for some time then all comes crashing down. As if it was a sign that my efforts are worthless.I really want this war in my head to end. Even though anxiety and depression have been giving me a hell of a time in these past months, somehow I still have hope left. Somehow I still do not want to give up. I feel like I am super strong but at the same time I feel weak. Not always, just rarely. Normally I ""only"" feel meh, like my default is a bit lower than the average, so I can still function properly but I do not have a drive, an ambition for anything. I do not want to be on autopilot or worse anymore, I am not sure how to change that though.(there is no need to write anything under this post, like I said it is just to clear my headspace a bit. But if you really want to comment, leave the negative energies out of it, I do not want to feel worse.) Battling with myself",1

I cannot tell if I have lost something or if I never had it. I have been called heartless and rude, but I do not react anymore its like its become a part of my character I have grown devoid of it.

"Hemorrhoids or Colon Cancer? Help? Help, freaking out a bit here.

Never considered the possibility of cancer.

Here's the symptoms:
- I'm young, 23, so I know I have the odds in my favor here as far as likelihood goes
- Itchy butt (it seems to start near my colon, but itches all the way up my crack and on my cheeks; this is why I initially thought it was a yeast infection); comes and goes depending on carb intake &amp; stress
- Just recently, I had some bad diarrhea and have been obnoxiously gassy since (for about the last week); farting is basically incessant
- Stools have normalized for the most part since, I'll have some hearty ones (the type you're proud of), sometimes some thinner ones, no additional diarrhea
- During the aforementioned diarrhea episode, there was some blood when I wiped (bright red, I seemed to come directly in contact with the ""source"" while wiping so not sure if that's a hemorrhoid or a polyp?); no blood in stool though
- Also, the itchy butt started after having sex w a girl I dated a few months ago (did an STD screening, negative)

What worries me is just the combo of the incessant gas + itchy burning butt + blood

Is a colonoscopy in order? Or does this sound like something less serious.

"I've missed about 3 weeks of class and I'm too embarrassed to go back-what do I do? Hi, I've recently started medication to help manage my anxiety. While adjusting to the medication, I noticed it helped my society anxiety a lot because I stopped caring. However, the downside is that I started to become very apathetic about everything and lost a lot of motivation to even get out bed/go to class. 

I've recently started a new medication and so far feelings of apathy/lack of productivity have improved, and I can now finish tasks (still not perfect, but I feel like with such a low starting dose it feels back to like how I've felt pre-medication.) The problem is, my social anxiety has gone back up. I'm ashamed and embarrassed to have missed so much class. I tried really hard this week and forced myself to go to classes I've been avoiding, but there is one class that I'm especially having a hard time getting myself to attend. The problem is, the class is very discussion based and we have predetermined groups we work with the entire semester. I'm worried my groupmates will judge me because I haven't been to class in so long, I just want to avoid the awkward confrontation ""Where have you been?"" even though I know it's inevitable. How do I force myself to go to class?",2

"aita for thinking my boyfriend responses were rude when i had a breakdown so i don’t really know where to talk about this and even if no one reads this it’s okay 

so i’ve been struggling with depression and bpd for years now due to traumatic experiences i’ve had with my family (mainly physical and mental abuse) i still live with my mother who has caused a lot of pain (i was told by a therapist to just accept her because i live here, in which is the same way she dictates the household) 
anyways so i’ve been dating my boyfriend for 2 years and although i’ve seen to be getting better, my mother and i had a physical altercation in which lead me to a downward spiral. It caused problems in my relationship as i know i don’t have the healthiest means of coping, many time we would have arguments that i could not emotionally handle because my depression has been getting the best of me and i know i am to blame but bear with me 

my boyfriend and i had a fight because i snapped at him over the phone, it wasn’t his fault and i felt really bad so i apologised but he said i was just being unnecessary, i said i was sorry for being unnecessary and he said he didn’t care, eventually he said he was over it and that we were okay but it left me feeling low because i’m not in the best of mind states, i recently lost my job (and been struggling to find another because not many places are looking at the moment) and my mother has been on my head about it. my mental state has been pretty low and i’m mostly disappointed in myself, i tend to put myself down a lot as i really wanted more for myself . I had a breakdown after our fight because i felt like i was being a burden to everyone including my boyfriend, i said i felt worthless and that i was sorry he had ti deal with like this and overall just going over how i felt like life would be easier w/o me 
he said that i’m always living in this self pity and that i’m never going to get better , he said i work on his nerves (paraphrasing because he said it much vulgar) and that that’s all i do lately in the middle of my break down and i just cried harder , this was over a video call so after he said that he just watched me cry, clearly annoyed , i said we could end the call if the crying bothered him and he said just end it because i’m tired of you 

i really feel so broken and like every aspect of my life",1

I have saved my fathers life at least 5x recently he just found out hes now diabetic I forced him to the hospital for them to help only to find out his sugar was 900. I was helping him today as I try to make sure he has as little to do as possible. I will not anymore after he yelled at me not listening about it not fitting by instead he calls me a dick head to which I replied with no you are being a stubborn asshole. Thus he squares up starts pushing me wanted to fight would not be a problem if he did not have major surgery on his stomach basically held together with tape. Now I am in my room cannot calm down and my meds are looking like the only way out of this hell. I told him he better never need help again even for health. I have cut ties if I find him on the floor so be it. it was his stubborn ass that put him this situation not mine. I am just not sure I want to do anymore on one hand I deal with a miserable father whom I dropped out of high school years ago because he was on the verge of death now hes trying to push me to death.,1

"It's always been something I have feared but it's got so much worse since developing anxiety. I think it stems down to the fact I had a tooth removed when I was only 5. Doesn't sound like a big deal but my mum didn't tell me I had to have it removed till the actual day. She just woke me up and got me in the car and told me we were going to the hospital (the children's dentist was at the hospital) so they could put me asleep and remove my tooth. Obviously at 5 that seemed pretty scary, didn't help that I had to wait 3 hours when I got there.",3

It's gotten to the point now where I regularly have nightmares about this event despite never remembering dreams, and any loud noise makes me want to cry, despite the fact I can't cry for the life of me. I have a few other things people commonly site, but I'd rather not talk about them here on reddit.

Now I am just a dead zombie that will laugh at things in public to not seem depressed. But my brain is so dead from depression I cannot come up with any jokes or shit. The only thing I can do is listen and barely speak which I actually hate. I want to be funny and have a personality and be desirable but I am not that. I know its depression that causes it.

"So, i always had depression, but now, i'am experiencing things that made me think if i'am a normal person.This seems ridiculous at first, but it is really affecting me.It all started when i engaged in a discussion about a horror movie that was released a week ago, i was really surprised that if a character is or not likable influence the way people like movies.I always see this in book or movie reviews, but i never cared about it until now.Again, i know that this sounds ridculous, but this is making me question my sanity.This is because my entire life, i never tought if a movie or book character is likable or not, i just live the moment.For example, in a horror movie, i never root for the main characters, if they are being chased by a killer or a monster, i never think ""oh, they must survive"", i just live the moment, if they live, ok, and if they die, that it is also ok.And i really prefer the horror movie antagonists over the heroes.it is really hard for me to understand this need to have ""likable"" characters in a book or movie, there are different kinds of people, we have good people, we have evil people, so if a character is not likable it ruins all the book or all the movie?What about the story?For example, i read a book about the Slenderman where the main character was not likable, but the fact that he was being terrorized by the Slenderman was enough for the book to be interesting, the main character does not need to be likable for me to know that he is in danger and for the Slenderman to be scary.I really need advice, i do not feel like a normalchuman anymore ,i'am crazy because i do not care if a character is or not likable in a story?I  the only one?

And I never reach out because I am ashamed.

I never been in a successful relationship, it was always I chasing the wrong guys or the wrong guys chasing me.

I also have a billion other phone calls I have been needing to make for weeks about other medical stuff but I just have not gotten thereIm doing really bad my meds stopped working two months ago and I quit my job and my mood is a rollercoaster throughout the day even though I do nothing but sit in my room. But does it matter. I do not even want to be happy. I am just fishing around for validation and attention. I cannot find the want for me to be happy in me so I search and hope for it in someone else. Fukin save me complex. cannot force myself to find a new therapist. / make phone calls,1

She was the best person. We had a relationship. Not a lover type. But a brother and sister type. I seriously treated her as my own older sister. I felt loved. She understood me. But I fucked up.

"My life has pretty much been a downward spiral for 9 years now, ever since I permanently injured my right shoulder in gymnasium (European equivalent of high school).The injury is what started it all, but as time passed, my depression gradually grew into what it is today, in the beginning it was only negative thoughts about my injury, but as time passed and the negative thoughts got worse, they started seeping into every aspect of my life, until negative, downright self deprecating thoughts became the norm.I no longer feel like I am actually living my life, it feels like I am just going through the motions, most days I just feel numb and I cannot remember what it is like to wake up and be excited about the day ahead. But just to be clear, I have accepted that I do not have it in me to kill myself, but if I am going to continue living, I do not want to continue down the self destructive path I am on. As for the lying part. As of writing this, I am completely broke, on the verge of being kicked out of my apartment and I was kicked out of my university for inactivity 2 months ago and after having studied for 4 years, I am actually happy that I do not have to study anymore, since enrolling was just a thing I did, mainly to have a community to be a part of, but it did not help me and the stress of constantly studying, just added to it all.My family do not know any of this and I have been too scared to tell them all this, but now I have reached a point where I do not care anymore and am actually considering telling them about it all. Also because they keep asking me about my studies and my life in general and I just cannot keep lying about it anymore, I cannot keep track of the lies and it is tearing me apart, that this is what my life has become. I am mainly considering telling them, because I have come to the conclusion that I cannot get out of this myself and that I need help. No matter what plans I make to lessen the feeling of hopelessness they all amount to nothing, as the crushing hopelessness of it all, makes it hard to must any energy to do anything but just drift along with whatever happens.I am not someone who usually discusses my feelings or emotional state with people, so any advice is much appreciated. I am considering just telling my family about my depression, so I do not have to lie about my life anymore.",1

"As someone who has recovered from health anxiety, I want to reiterate how true the pinned post about reassurance is u/nathan98900 has posted some excellent advice about how reassurance feeds health anxiety. If you are not hypochondriac and you get stressed due to a chest pain, then yes, reassurance will work for you and you will get on with your life. But if you are hypochondriac, since your mind is in ""worry-mode,"" when you are reassured about one of your symptoms, yes you will feel temporary relief, but it is very likely you will probably find something new to worry about. I was sick and tired of worrying about every single symptom and spending a fortune on dozens of doctors. So one day I decided that I will stop caring about my symptoms and stopped googling and got on with my life no matter what. Then for a few weeks my symptoms and anxiety become worse, almost unbearable. Of course they would be. My anxious mind had got used to the instant gratification from reassuarance seeking and was begging for that. But I had said to myself that I would keep myself busy and distracted no matter how anxious I was and ignore my symptoms no matter how much panic I had. Then, something very logical happened. My mind decided that since I am not reacting to all these symptoms, then they must not be that serious. So it could take some time off and relax and not worry anymore. Then anxiety slowly dissipated and along with that all these symptoms that I thought could give me a diagnosis of 20 extra rare fatal diseases went away as well. 

Also remember that almost all people recover. You do not see that in this sub, because people that recover do not come back to post. You may feel hopeless now, but it is certain that you will be fine eventually once you find what works for you. This is what worked for me btw:

"I am so done. I have to deal with my parents constantly breaking down my confidence that I am trying to work on and being VERY mentally abusive. I get comments about my weight, my intelligence, my clothing style, my actions, etc. I cannot even breath without being judged. my parents like to twist the word ""respect"" so i get treated like shit but then I have to walk on eggshells when I am around them. it is not like I am a bad kid. I have A's/B's, planning for college, never get into any trouble, yet I am constantly ridiculed like I am the worst kid in the world. Then I have my friends where recently they have been judging me as well for multiple things. They make my parents sound like they are ""the best and chillest parents ever"" when they have NO idea what happens behind closed doors. I have ADHD and anxiety and one of the things that I do is that I cannot function if my hands are dry so i carry around lotion with me. EVERY time i would take out the lotion they would give me a weird look. They also like to call me out on a lot of things or call me names just at random and it does not help my already not very mental state. My one friend has called me a 'pig' before on multiple occasions and always has to point out my SH scars and call them 'tic tac toe' like its some sort of joke when all it does is make me want to cut again. I am trying so hard to work on myself and work on my confidence but I feel like I am suffocating. OH also to mention I have found out alcohol causes my spiraling thoughts to temporarily go away so now I am trying not to start an addiction to either SH or Alcohol but I have no one to fucking help me or be there for me without having that feeling of being judged. I also had my girlfriend try to hurt herself and her homophobic parents found out about us so now I have not heard from her for over 2 weeks. I am trying to cope with everything and no one even seems to care. I am just a fucking kid yet I feel like everyone is treating me like I should know how to fix every single problem I have. I want someone to hold my hand and tell me it is going to be okay. I want that embrace of a hug that makes me feel like all my problems have gone away. I want help. I want to be happy like how I was when I was younger. Why did I have to grow up so fast. I am done with constant mental abuse",1

Now I've been scratched by a third wild animal. I don't want receive more doses of the vaccine.

This is kind of rambling but I have been like this before, and then I have periods where I do not feel like this at all and a mostly normal. I honestly do not really think this is depression, But it seems similar to what other people have written about depression so I figured I might as well ask. I will occasionly have very vivid thoughts about killing myself, I have no desire to ever do that, but more and more I think about it constantly. I also will have the num feeling interrupted by random directionless anger sometimes. I do not know what triggers this. Anyway, dose this seem like depression to anyone here, and if so, what can I do about it? I tend to perfure the periods in my life where I have more feelings. Do I Have Depression",1
Then more lies come up and closure seems impossible. Marriage. I am trying to change,1
"Hey guys, I am not depressed but Id like to know how a depressed person thinks. I am feeling really resentful towards my bfs ex who has depression as she tried to reach out to my bf for another chance at the relationship and to get him to help her with her depression. i feel like it was unreasonable for her to come back to his life when they are not together anymore and it just makes me hate her. My bf says she is depressed hence he let her down nicely or talks to her carefully because hes scared she will kill herself.I know I am being somewhat of a bitch rn, so please help me understand how a depressed person thinks because rn I just want to fight her Help me understand depression",1
"Something told me to make this post. I do not want sympathy, or I am sorry, or any of that. I am past that. I have made lots of posts in the past to get that kind of response. That kind of connection to another human, recognize my pain. This post is not about that, it may seem like it is, I suppose, but it is not. I guess, I just want to tell the story of why I have depression and anxiety and so many other mental illnesses. it is going to be a long post, and for that, I do not expect many people to read it.I have contemplated suicide, but never attempted it. By contemplate, I mean I held a gun in my hand, looked it up and down, loaded it, put it in my mouth, put it against my head, and thought very deeply about pulling the trigger. I have contemplated suicide for at least 10 years now. It has put me in a state where I am both godless and god-fearing. The best place to start, I think, is the first trauma I remember and go from there. When I was about 5-6 I had a crush on a boy in my class. If it matters, I am a bisexual male, more on that later. Well, I was quite innocent of the idea of love and what one should like and not like, so I told my mom about the crush. Her response was to scratch me across the face and call me a faggot. I still have the scars to this day. Four scars on the left side of my face. I made a post the other day showing my face, but you cannot really see them, I do not like to draw attention to them, and thankfully no one has ever asked about them.That is the tip of the iceberg. When my parents were still together, she would lock us out of the house. Hot summer days in the Ohio River valley. We would be out there for hours, upwards of 6 hours without water or food. And really I guess this is the lesser of it, not so bad, we were kids, play outside she would tell us. So we did, we just could not go back in until she called us. Anyways, I really looked forward to school days. This went on for a few years, I was between the ages of 5 and 10.School itself was not so bad. I did not learn to read until I was in the 3rd grade, and I was always taken out of class because I had special classes I had to go to, including one for a speech impediment, I could not say my Rs, the speech impediment went on till I was almost in High School.Well, when my parents got divorced was when the fun really began, I say fun because I try to think on the lighter side of it, could have been worse. I remember every aspect of the father's first apartment. We lived near a small airport, the house was two stories, we lived on the first floor. Entering the house, on the right was a staircase that led upstairs to the landlord's apartment. Directly in front of the front door was the door that led into the basement, where the washer and dryer were, concrete floors, largely empty space, was not much in there. The third door was my father's apartment, to the left. A white door, it led into the living room. There was a fireplace, a smallish TV, the couch my sister slept on, my dad's drawing table, and a couple of bookcases. In fact, I am going to stop here and suffice to say that I could describe to you every detail of that apartment. All except my room. I can not tell you anything about my room. I do not know what color the door was, I do not know what side of the wall the beds were on, I know nothing about that room. What I do know, or at least strongly suspect, is that I was raped in that room over a period of 2 years. Aforementioned memory lapse aside, I am told by my brother that I say ""No, do not do it, stop"" in my sleep quite often. My sister, deceased sister, had similar gaps of memory and told me one day that she suspected it was happening. And thirdly, NSFW warning, my anus has a tear in it. I was about 12-14, as memory serves that I lived in that apartment on the weekends. A mighty bold claim, I do not remember the actual events, but I believe there is evidence to lead to that conclusion. I want to think that I am wrong, but part of me tells me it is true.There are more minor things in my childhood that come to mind, but I think they really do pale compared to what I have already said. To this day, my family is, well, unloving. They will tell me they love me, but they do not show it. In fact, the only time they really listen, or half-listen, is when I threaten suicide. This could be why I contemplate it so much, just to be heard. Neither of my parents could give a shit about what inspires me, what passions I have, what love I feel. Two examples, I wanted to be a paleontologist until I was 16, loved dinosaurs, I kept this, like many other things, to myself., until one day I told my dad. He said I would never be a paleontologist, I should give up on that idea, and that I should instead be an engineer like he was. The second example, I love playing the piano, I know virtually nothing about it, I am self-taught, and frankly, I feel I can play a pretty damn good improv. My mother, frequently, tells me I am terrible at it and that I need lessons. Which may very well be true, I may be terrible and everyone else who has heard me play is lying to me, I do certainly need lessons because I cannot read music, although I do not have much interest in playing what someone else wrote, it is an emotional release for me and I like it that way, so I am stubborn.Perhaps some of this post is just whining, I need to grow up, I need to move on. I should not be defined by my past or what others say. And most of the time I try to keep that mindset, what is in the past is in the past, but (I was once told by a very wise man to not use the word but, because it negates everything you said before, I feel it is needed here) the past can still hurt. And perhaps that is why I am making this post, not on a throwaway account, I thought about that. But like my scars, let the world see this, my past does define me in some way, it has certainly shaped me. I have come to the end of this post and I still don' know the purpose. It does not make it feel any better, and no one can go back and change any of this, and quite frankly I am not even depressed about it right now. I was earlier today when my brother threatened to kick me out because I have not done the dishes in a few days, but not at the moment of writing. Maybe, and I think this is true, maybe I just need someone to know these things. Not because it has any real impact on their life, I certainly do not think anyone is going to read this and say, MY GOD, MY LIFE IS CHANGED. No, I think I just wanted someone to know my pain, my past. I suppose I am sorry you read that. Me",1

"I fainted in a bar. Should I be worried?? I had a cold this past week and was getting better but feeling dehydrated 
Decided to go out drinking and ended up smoking some weed and having 5 beers
Was standing at the bar for about an hour and we ordered some bar snacks, about 5 minutes into eating I felt very lightheaded and nauseous, started seeing black circles, tried to make my way outside to get some air, and dropped to the floor at that moment 
I came to a few minutes later, sat at a table sipping water, and felt pretty much fine other than being kinda tired and still lightheaded

Could this have been just a routine fainting spell? I’m attributing it to dehydration, since I️ was sick, drank a lot of coffee during the day, and then drank alcohol, without really drinking any water. I also read that prolonged standing can reduce blood flow to the brain. I plan on getting checked out by a doctor this week. Should I be worried? 

TLDR: Was dehydrated, fainted in a bar while standing for awhile, felt fine after",2

"TW: mentions of sexual assault&amp;#x200B;This year in February I was sexually assaulted on a school field trip. It was from a guy who was in one of the other classes but he was still in my grade. He picked me up and put his hands in places that made me VERY uncomfortable. I yelled at the guy to stop and he did but it still made me uncomfortable.A few months later I decided to come forward and talk to a teacher from my school about it in hope that she would help or at least do something. One of my close friends came with me to talk to the teacher as I did not feel strong enough to talk to her alone. My friend and I talked to the teacher, let us call her Mrs. X, and at first, Mrs. X seemed understanding and supportive. Later that day Mrs. X pulled me and my friend out of class to write down a few things to back up my allegations. I made a witnesses list as other people had witnessed my being assaulted. This was followed by my witnesses being interviewed and giving details.On my final period on a Friday, I was pulled out of my class and Mrs. X pulled me into an empty classroom and sat me down. For the next hour, she ran me through about how I was lying and that one of the witnesses had told her that I was lying and just did not like the guy who assaulted me and I was doing it all for a laugh. As anyone would, I sat in that classroom and cried. Mrs. X believed one witness and not the victim. Then came the scariest thing I had heard, ""You will likely be charged with false reporting of sexual assault and will have a permanent criminal record"". Now I am a good person I have never got a detention or anything but I would not say I am the teacher's pet but still, of all the things that I thought could have come from me coming forward this was not one of them. &amp;#x200B;I spent the whole weekend in fear. I could not afford to have a criminal record. I had not even told my parents about it. I was so angry at my school for doing this to me. I know that I was sexually assaulted and I would never ever make things like that up. I was furious but also very scared of what would happen next. I heard nothing about the situation till the next Tuesday, two weeks after I came forward. Mrs. X pulled me out of class again and into her office. She told me that the guy's family did not want to give me a criminal record or charge me. Then she looked me in the eye and said that I was a lair and that I was overreacting.&amp;#x200B;Overall, Mrs. X still does not believe that I was assaulted. And I am thankful that the guy's parents were nice enough to not send my life into a downward spiral. i got in trouble for being sexually insulted",1

"Please help! Hey guys, I have an on-site interview after being a complete depressed, socially angst hermit for the last 6 months. When I say I didn’t go out of my house more than 4 times in 6 months, best believe it😂 
I applied for a job and I have to fly to another state for it. I thought things were getting better with me but my anxiety is through the roof just thinking about the travel, but mostly the interview. It’s a 2hour session from 10-12pm. 
I usually take 10 mg of propranolol, but I don’t think it ll be enough. Do you guys think it’s ok to take 20mg. Before you ask me to ask my doctor, he said I should take 10-20 mg but I have never taken 20 mg before and I am scared I ll pass out or I won’t be able to breath (had asthma when I was younger). 
I was thinking maybe of taking one at 8am and then another at 9.30am-ish. 
What do you guys think? Anyone with experience? 
Also I m a “little” female despite being in my mid 30s . 5 feet and 110lbs",2

"will i ever be noticed? is my life worth anything? i spend all day doing nothing, full of sorrow and pain, while wishing pain on others. i waste my time, day, after day, after day, slowly killing myself mentally. the isolation is killing me. i have no one to talk to about it, it feels like I am going to hurt myself or someone else, but I am too afraid to act on it solely because i do not want to go back to the mental hospital. who am i? why am i here? what is my point anymore? i do not want to waste away like this, i work so hard to get better, my days always start off promising but go to shit quickly. it feels like life itself is playing me like a fiddle, why though? what did i do to deserve this pain? I have been like this since i was a mere toddler, so why me? did i commit a major sin in my past life? was there a past life? i do not know anymore. i wanted to grow up to help people, to be a leader, to change peoples lives for the better, but now i will not be anything. at most, ill be homeless, at worst ill be dead, but is it really that bad? is it bad to lose my life anymore? nobody would miss me. i destroyed all of my relationships. i only have my mother, i love my mother, she is been through so much, she is so strong and I am so proud of her, but i do not think i want to continue to live like this. i just want to escape, i cannot embrace this life anymore, for it has brought me to my knees. if anyone ever sees this, i it will probably be after my death. so be it. nobody would miss me. i do not care anymore. i will not even miss myself. I am just too afraid to go through with it, i do not have a gun, i do not have anything of that sort, so what do i do? i do not feel like a human. i feel subhuman, i feel like nothing, why was i born this way, WHY? WHAT THE FUCK DID I DO? I DID NOTHING. I JUST WANTED A NICE AND SAFE JOURNEY, BUT OF COURSE I HAD TO GO INSANE FROM ISOLATION. this is not even mentioning all of the voices and stuff i see, its probably due to loneliness, i hear people calling my name, a comforting girls voice, a girl i do not even know, a girl i will never know. right before i sleep i am haunted with the noises of people saying my name, as if I am at my deathbed. i know it is unrealistic, though. because no one would miss me in reality. I am a nobody, i do nothing to help other people, I have been a mental cripple my entire life. its only become apparent recently, when all of my friendships came falling down solely because i am a horrible friend, and horrible, narcissistic, degenerate of a person in general. this is not even the worst I have felt, last night was when i cried harder than I have ever cried, i had to cover my mouth to prevent screaming, i do not want my mom to worry about me. my mom deserves everything for how hard she works for me, even after my dad died. i know my dad would be sad if i go through with killing myself, but hes not here anymore, hes in a better place. i know that my life is going to get worse from here, my teenage years have just started, and it feels like i am really losing my mind. do i deserve this? is this because of all my past mistakes? i do not know, and i will not ever know. what hurts most is that everyone i know would tell me how much i change, that i was not the same funny, happy, helpful me. that is what my friend told me right before we stopped talking. I am such a selfish fucking bitch. i always talk about other people not being empathetic, but i myself am not empathetic, and only paint myself to be so other people feel bad, am i really just this bad of a person? is all I am looking for a reaction from everyone so that i can finally know they care, or make them care? i do not know. i do not know answers to any of this. i feel like I am going insane with all these thoughts flowing around my head, there is nothing that calms them anymore, i am just filled with negative emotions, and i have no way to control them. i know i will never be off meds. last time i was, i was crying harder than i have ever cried, and i had the worst homicidal thoughts. at this point, its a struggle to keep myself from hurting myself and others. i bet it would be a lot better for everyone if i was gone, nobody would be hurt. thank you if you read this whole thing. it feels like I am the only one alive, like I am in a city at night, snow all over, with the streets being empty, not a sign of life. i feel like this is a key part of my narcissistic thinking, i believe that i am special in some way, i am not, but i think that to make myself feel better about being a nobody. I am done showing everyone empathy when they show not a single bit of concern back. am i really selfish for doing that, when they do not do anything to make me feel better? nobody even comforts me anymore. i do not I am just sitting at my chair, writing all day about my thoughts. not sure why, its just addicting, it makes me see the point I am at, my thinking, my supposed insanity. when will it get better? will it really ever get better? i do not feel angry anymore. I am just full of sorrow and pain. the mere hope that someone is sees what I am going through and helps out is the only thing keeping me going, but i know at one point it will be gone. gone like my past self, gone like my friends, gone like my dad, gone like everything i ever loved, gone like all of my hopes and dreams. what if i show this to my doctor? would that help? or would he throw me in a mental hospital? I am already suspicous of the meds, I am suspcious of everyone who works as a mental health professional, they just work to make money off of peoples suffering, that is what my brain tells me. i know its the truth because i have seen human greed for money and power. the current society is destroying the regular human, while benefitting the small minority at the top. have i really made any progress in the last what, year and a half? i do not feel like i have. it feels like everythings getting worse. everything has gotten worse. if my mother would to die, that would be the final straw, at that point i really have no one. my mother was right, other people do not give a single FUCK about my problems. because they are all selfish and horrible people. everyone i know is, i have not met a single person who is not. is it just me? or what? i find it funny how my important would go up if i committed suicide. if i killed myself right now, everyone would come rushing, not because they care, but because they think they have the blood on their hands. they do not. its all on me, I am the one who decided to take my life to begin with. i was not born on my own, but i have the right to take my life, because i will be preventing other people from harm. i am a danger to myself and everyone around me at this point. i feel like I am at the point in my life where there is nothing left to do, but die. like i have the choice between sitting here, having pain, rotting away slowly, or killing myself and getting over with it. i feel like i relate to my dad a bit, when he was on the ventilator, it was causing him pain, that is why he had to be taken off. just like how i cannot stand the pain anymore, the pain is going to continue till i take my life. I am tired of seeing everyone else succeed, while I am sitting here crying about all my problems like the little bitch i am. I am jealous, just another sign that i am indeed a horrible person. i have never been proud of myself, nobody has ever been proud of me. i am a waste of oxygen, people promise that they care, but they are two faced liars. I KNOW IT. nobody would care about me simply because i do not benefit them in anyway. if i did benefit them, they would care. does that just show my hipocrisy? that i am really just a selfish person too? this has myself at a loss of words, because i was proven right by myself, i am simply a horrible person. i am the type of person i hate. so why continue? what is my point then? just to sit and continue to feel sadness and anger? i keep remembering when i first started to hurt, when i first was diagnosed with mental illness, it was not a shocker, it was not as bad as it is now. i feel paranoid, what if the meds only make me feel worse? what if they just want me to get worse so i pay them money until i die? fuckers. i was proven right, but this time about other people. when did it all go wrong, i do not understand, i say it started when i was young because i would harm myself, hallucinate, and have other symptoms, but am i right? idk. i just want to be like everyone else my age. i do not want to be who i am right now, feeling like a 25 year old man trapped inside of his apartment all day having no one to talk to and barely making by. the loneliness of this all, the fear of missing out, the want to be loved, to be held, to be cared for, its killing me inside, along with everything else. i will never experience love, i will never experience true care, i am too far gone at this point, there is no fucking point anymore. i do not want to live anyways, i will not experience the best things life has to offer. when i get my hands on a gun, the first thing I am going to do is go out for a walk, just enjoy the weather, then end it. so it can end on a calming note. nobody will miss me at all, not my mom, she will probably be dead due to preexisting conditions, i will not have anyone. why the fuck am i looked down upon by everyone for being mentally ill? it makes no sense to me. i feel like they are afraid of me, not that they think they are better, is this me anymore or this is something else? someone told me this is not me, this is my mental illness, what if i am my mental illness? i do not know to be honest. i think I am the real problem here, i think I am better than others, i think I am smarter, better, everything. I am just so unsure of everything now, my future, my life, my relationships. I am slowly discovering that I am just a really toxic person, why else would people start leaving me? its because i am objectively horrible. i do not care about anyone. i just want myself to be happy at the expense of others, its ironic, because i wanted to help others, and wanted mutual trust, but nope. i am really just this. i do not feel insane right now, just sort of filled with thoughts, feelings, i do not feel emotions or any form of empathy anymore, am i long gone? what happened to me? why does everyone say that the past me is gone, why? i do not know what changed. i do not feel the same, no, but i do not know what changed either. i want to be the old me again, I have been like this forever but it was not as severe before, what made it severe? will i ever know? i think everyone i know thinks this is an act, even when i tell them what is wrong, they seem to ignore it, they hope for the best, but the worst keeps coming, over and over, every day. my life is at the same point it was at when i was almost admitted to the mental hospital, which would have been the second time, but i was able to hide it well enough to where they did not think i was completely crazy. i do not know how long i can keep hiding it, i do not think i hide it anymore anyways, i just think people stopped caring about it, because it was not their problem. I am tired of not being noticed, not being able to experience what others are experiencing, i want to be like them, i want to be happy, i do not want to be what i am right now, right now i am a complete and utter mess, and i have nothing and no way to fix it. i do not know how long before i snap completely, i already feel like i have. i do not know when i might do something irrational to someone else or myself, the unpredictability of mental illness is what makes it so fucking bad. i just want to be happy. I am looking through all of my notes and seeing all my plans, all my schedules, everything i planned for the future, plans that i will never be able to fulfill. if i were given the independence i seek so badly, i would have ended myself, is that a good thing? i do not know. i think it would be good for the world if i was gone, i just feel like a burden to everyone at this point. i wrote a longer rant and bridged them all together, plus some more thoughts, should i talk to my doctor about this? i feel like he does not know what is wrong.",1
"I do not know how to express it but I just feel sad and empty all of a sudden. I do not want to call it depression or self diagnose myself. I really want to get checked but it is very costly in our country, also I do not even know where to start or how to express this feeling with a doctor. My parents do not know this feeling I am having because I am always happy and loud in our home. I have not been outdoors since the pandemic happened, I started to work from home since last year and the only time I go out is when I do groceries. I have plenty of hobbies.

problematic friend and a proper support system this entire time i wa never strong because i wanted to be i had no choice but to be i m not a strong person keeping false hope by holding onto delusion to get by isn t what it mean to be strong i know the life i m living now won t last forever but the damage caused by everything i ve gone through is beyond repair i m unfixable my whole life ha been nothing but a buildup of trauma and it ll continue to be it ll never end more than anything i wish someone cared about me would hold my hand and tell me everything s going to be alright hug me when i cry into my pillow at night hold me when i m breaking down because i m not strong enough to take on the pain alone but no i ll never have anyone like that in my life only in my delusional mind if any word defines my life it s alone i ve taken this journey of endless trauma alone none ha ever truly cared everyone just watch me stagger along i wonder why i even wasted any of my time going to therapy none of my therapist have ever cared nothing ever changed i never felt any better i m currently feeling the worst i ve ever felt in my entire life i ve experienced so much pain throughout my whole life but nothing like this this pain destroyed all my dream destroyed who i once wa a a person there s only one way from here now and it s more down then i already am taking medication for my problem isn t what i need throwing pill at my problem isn t going to make me forget about everything that s ever happened in my life the only two thing that would be able to do that for me is severe brain trauma or death i m not going to use drug a mean of coping with my life using drug to solve and help with my problem i may be a worthless individual but i m wise enough to know having to take pill a a mean of getting better isn t the life i want i just need a human being in my life that care about me that is able to see my worth tell me i m more than all of this trauma however i know the reality and i won t sugarcoat it i come with too many challenge for anyone to have any sort of care for me i suffer from skin picking severe depression and anxiety ptsd constant disassociation where i forget who i actually am and feel like the world isn t real i m far too fucked up it explains why i have no friend why i have none in my life who truly care about me because of how long all of my problem have gone untreated i can t escape my suicidal thought my problem will always define who i am will always have the last say in everything i do nothing give me happiness anymore not food not drawing not reading or writing not watching the sunrise not the moon not late night not going outside not sleeping nothing all of it feel pointless now and it doesn t provide me happiness like it used to me i ve always preferred to keep my emotion to myself and not go to my parent for help because everytime i do i get the same response they always invalidate my feeling it s endless response that always tear me down they tell me i m overreacting that i should leave my problem in the past that i should stop being a crybaby that i should grow up already and stop being problematic saying that others have life worse and i shouldn t complain about it there s no point in wasting my time asking them for help i have none else i can reach out to none else that care i wa hospitalized a month ago after i told my school counselor about my suicidal thought what happened my parent were called i wa forced to go to the hospital and i got cussed out badly they said a variety of hurtful thing but what stuck with me the most wa being told that if i were actually suicidal i d have done it already telling me i m nothing but an attention seeker telling me i wasted my time asking for help and going to the hospital because no give a shit about me anyways no care at all for the fact that i m in the hospital because i don t want to live anymore i didn t choose to be open about being suicidal because i m an attention seeker i did it because i needed help surviving if my own parent don t care about me how can i expect anyone else to have any care for me the only living being i have left now is my lovely boy sled he may only be a dog but he s all i have left in this world unfortunately i just don t know if that s enough at this point to keep me going life ha given up on me so i want to give up on myself i m tired of my life consisting of surviving plainly existing without no meaning i don t want be strong anymore i don t want to live in my head anymore i never want to experience trauma ever again i want to escape i want to be free i m not sure if i ll ever get that chance in life and even if i do it won t be anytime soon if i had to guess possibly in a few year but i can t hold on that long hell i don t even know if i can make it to the end of 0 people with proper support system really don t realize how lucky they truly are that s the only that could save me from myself and the only thing i look forward to in the future if i make it the chance i ll have my own support system one of the worst mistake i kept repeating wa thinking that professional help would magically make everything better somehow it didn t i m never taken seriously because to them i m just another mentally ill person that doesn t hold much worth fuck that i do have many mental illness but i m aware and i sure a hell know what my reality is and what s going on i ve recently come to realize you can t rely on anyone but yourself to help you get better obviously this is far from easy when you re suicidal the harsh reality is i can give up or continue living my life in misery this isn t just the harsh reality for me but so many other individual who are suicidal or have suicidal thought or ideation it s not fair at all and none should ever have to come to that realization i feel like i m a lost cause now i m beyond sick and tired of hearing there s hope for the future something brighter to look forward to for the past few year i ve been feeling suicidal all i ve been doing is taking life one step at a time taking it day by day waiting for that one where thing finally start to turn around for me but it hasn t all the time i wonder maybe there s nothing left in my future except loneliness emptiness more nightmare to dream about more tear to shed and more trauma to endure i don t want to live like this anymore although i don t wish to die only escape this life i d rather be dead i don t want to be this aware i don t want to feel like this anymore i don t want the feeling of worrying about what the future hold to consume me anymore being failed by the system failed by society and failed by life is why i m suicidal,1

"I don't care to live anymore, and I haven't seen a point to it for a long time This may turn into a ramble and be somewhat disjointed so apologies in advance.

I'm a 21 year old guy from the UK and I've been planning and thinking of ways to end my life since the start of the year. I've been in a dark place for as long as I can remember, never seeing a point to life when we just die in the end, been bullied since year 3 of Primary school all the way until I finished my GCSEs. From the start of 2023 I've hit the lowest I think I ever have, with little to no care for life anymore and just wishing I was dead. I've planned the typical things like hangings, thought of the overdose routes, dangerous driving, whatever I have access to I've considered what ways I could kill myself with them.

As far as life goes I never really saw a point to it if death is just going to be the inevitable end, so why not just make it sooner? 

I cut off contact with all but 3 of my friends from secondary school shortly after finishing GCSEs, 1 of which died last year, 1 was my ex (we remained good friends, had some rough patches though) who just up and blocked me midway through last year with no explanation as to why, and the last I don't talk to all that much. I am quite an angry person from all of the bullying I've endured and most of the outbursts are often me exclaiming ""I just want to KMS/die"" and everything in relation. I have an online friend group who has often heard my outbursts but they take no notice and seemingly don't care.

I was at college until 2020 when I completed my course, but of course COVID happened and my future plans were all thrown out the window. So I've mostly just tried to cope with that and find jobs to act as a stop-gap until I can find an opportunity in the field I want to be in, but I've lost all motivation and care for finding it.

I always see the things of ""do something that makes you happy"" or ""find someone who will listen to you"" or whatever other bullshit people say to make you reconsider killing yourself, but none of them are useful. If anything they make me want to do it more. At this point in my life I'm nothing but a burden and a mental weight on those around me, I'm in this dark pit and quite frankly don't have the care anymore to try and get out of it since I always seem to end up back here but falling further in every time. I can't live through another cycle of this process.

I'm done, and I think it's time I start preparing and fulfilling some of those plans I've made.",1

"My old best friend hates me and I don’t know why This all started last august. She has a boyfriend that I didn’t mind at first then he started saying the n word and plenty of other slurs all the time (he is white btw). She hated this but stayed w him. He always bullied me and was so disrespectful to me and my house. One time even made fun of my small breasts in front of her and she didn’t care. She usually took his side and would even leave us hanging out randomly to be w him 

Last august for my birthday I went camping and I asked if she wanted to go. She asked if her bf could go and I said my friends (the ones camping w me) didn’t really know him and I don’t like how he says so many slurs. She got upset w me but then we were fine. She started ghosting me and we stopped hanging out even though I kept trying to reach out.

In December I texted her saying I missed her and wanted to hangout. She was ignoring me for a whole day. I thought maybe she got a new phone number so I asked my bf to text her. She blocked him. It took me to tell her that this situation was ridiculous for her to respond and to tell me she’s “too stressed to be around ppl bc she’s starting school” I don’t think she’s going to college rn. 

Today I texted her saying I wanted to talk and realized I made her upset and wanted to apologize. I noticed she blocked me so I asked her friend if she could unblock me and she did. My old bsf responded with (to her friend to tell me) “sorry about that”. 

I don’t know what I did to make her hate me so much. It hurts so bad and I’ve been crying all day. We were best friends for years and were so close.",3

One of the times my mouth was wide open, my throat completely dry, and my neck as stiff as a rock. During the dream I felt my heart racing and beating so hard my chest still hurts, and I woke up completely covered in sweat and my body aching real bad.

I know i should tell someone and open up but I am afraid of oversharing or that people will not take me serious. i feel alone but its my fault,1

"I can't even wash my hands when no one will see that I did it   Hello! Today, I (18M) fully realized that I cannot function properly as a human being, unless I'm directly seeking acceptance in others. This translates to me not showering, not brushing my teeth, not shaving, not even washing my hands when no one is going to see that I am clean and ""normal"".

  
 I recently started college, I've been making friends and generally having a great time, this, if u look at it from the outside. 

  
 Inside my head, I just cannot get the sense out of my mind that someone is going to think less of me and criticize me physically, because of my clothes, my face, my hair, because I have a gray shadow even after just 30 minutes of shaving, because somehow I smell bad, etc. I have crippling anxiety just thinking about someone criticizing my looks in their heads (And don't let me start with my personality), basically all this converts into me having a sort of ""Double life"".

  
When I need to go outside, I do all the work I can possibly do to try and look nice, smell good and be a nice person. But the moment I'm in my home, my mind unconsciously switches to a gross side, I don't take care of myself in any way type or form, suddenly I am mean, lazy, antisocial and want to die once again. The cycle repeats day after day, I've been trying to make myself go to the gym and eat better for months now, but my body just doesn't respond, every fiber of my mind tells me that I can't do anything right, I will always be kinda ugly, kinda fat, and kinda gross, so why bother trying?

"Well, this is going to be a long read. I have been coming to terms with what happened to me while I was in uni. I was taken advantage of while insanely messed up by someone who was close to sober. It changed my perspective on life and honestly I became much less trustworthy of people. Uni was hard to get through this year, but I have been grinding and slowly fixing the pieces academically. I wanted to put this event as far as I could from my memory. The so called event was one of the first ever sexual experiences I had and it broke me. Getting taken advantage of while fucked off my ass is something that broke me down. I also started drinking much heavier more frequently. Anyways, on one of my blackout nights. I was shitfaced coming back from a pub. A girl I had previously hooked up with was there chilling with my flat mate, not as hammered. Apparently we made out and I wanted to go further. Nothing happened and I did not think too much of it at the time. However, a few weeks later a friend of mine &amp;; her were playing a drinking game in my room. As the night winded out, I asked about the blackout night to get more clarity. I learned that I was pestering her for a bit about going further. I asked if I did anything shitty and her tone changed and she genuinely said I did not do anything shitty or scummy. We made out again (consensual) and I have left it at that. This experience is a bit dicey for me, I did not do anything physical, but apparently I tried to get her into my room in other ways by just asking consistently and even going to the extent of asking her to help me find something in my room while blacked out. I was very drunk and although I was not being forceful/threatening by any means, however it looks more like I could not catch a hint while that messed up. Also to clarify, our flat is one story and my mates room is right next to mine.Since then, I think we are still on normal terms. I am still on ok terms with her, and she even invited me out to a party when I asked if she had any moves for the night, furthermore my friend was giving me shit for that night and slid up on her story when asking if anyone wanted to go to the beach with her and pointed my name to which she snap chatted me if I wanted to go. She also recently sent me an old photo of us blazed, so I do think there is no bad blood. Also, I feel like I would have heard something from her friends if I had done something heinous &amp;; I do not sense any bad blood as they are still chill with me even months after. Also, if I had done something shitty I feel like my flat mate would have told me or her friends. Both her friends (and her) have been victims of SA &amp; I am Almost certain that I would have been called out if I had done anything shitty. Anyways, I probably will not ever see this person again. She mainly hung out with my flat mate, and I am living somewhere new next year, and I have kind of begun growing out of my party phase. Plus, I was planning on cutting this whole group out over time initially. she is not in uni either, hence realistically we probably will not see each other ever again. I do not know if I should casually text her asking for more clarity or if I should maybe text her to test the waters. Realistically, she probably has not put too much thought into this and I am most likely overreacting. Furthermore, I am assuming she is probably chalked it up to me being butt fuck drunk that night. Yet, my anxiety has been eating me up about this whole situation as I have little to no memory of the night. Its been a few months since all of this went down, and i initially had moved on. However, my mind keeps fixating on this night. I am a respectful guy and I do not think I did anything shitty, but I am still over-analyzing the situation. I do not know the details of the situation, and I have no clue of the little nuances of what occurred. Reading stuff about peoples experiences online are making me question if my actions were on the same degree of fucked up as what I have read on different threads. I do not think they are, yet I am still feeling extremely anxious about this whole thing due to fact that I do not know exactly what happened. I have been overthinking and its been eating away at me for a few days. I also want to see a therapist as I do not think I have fully gotten over the first situation, however I am worried that also bringing up this situation could get me in trouble even though I most likely have not done anything bad if that makes sense. I do not know why, but I just feel stressed even though I most likely did not do anything shitty or terrifyingly bad. If anyone could give me advice on what to do, please help me out. Also, an honest breakdown on this whole situation would be helpful. I am considering reaching out to her casually, but I do not know if that is the right move. This has been eating at me for a few days and I am just lost &amp; confused. Most guys would probably not even put much second thought into this, buts its bloody bothering me like crazy.

"Can't stop worrying For the past few weeks I've been having flashing in my vision. It's usually a very small white light that appears for a split second then goes away once I try to look at it. Well ever since that started happening I've like been sent over the edge and am almost constantly worrying that I have a myriad of neurological diseases, from a stroke to retinal detachment to a brain tumor. I've also been having stomach pains like nausea for the past few days but I'm not sure if im making up phantom nausea because I'm worried I have a brain tumor. I also have had some on and off mild headaches but like I said above I could just be imagining it into existence. I went in yesterday for a full eye exam and the optomologist said my eyes, retina and all are in perfect condition. Because of this I am now more than ever convinced I have a brain tumor and am about to die. Sorry for the rant I just needed somewhere to vent.

Pre-made or take out food is easier but it is still challenging to actually sit down and eat it. It helps if I eat with a friend but obviously that is not something routine.

"Bad Tattoo Experience making me lose my mind I got a large elbow tattoo Wednesday and it's RUINED my mental since, to make a very long story short basically the tattoo artist wasn't as clean as I'd like him to be, he didn't even wash his hands before putting on his gloves and tattooing me, the needle and grip were new but the tattoo wire was not covered in plastic or the workspace. He says that he uses a very strong cleaner between every client but my mind doesnt want to accept it.

To make it all worse he didn't do the tattoo i even wanted, and did a fucking terrible job so now i have a huge bad tattoo with a terrible story with it and just waiting til i can lazer it off.

"Bruise anxiety I have a bruise appear on my outer thigh. About an inch wide. 

3 days ago when I noticed it, it was actual 2 bruises, a smaller and larger bruise.

The next day, the smaller bruise was nearly gone. The larger looked like it was fading. 

Last night, the large bruise was a red circle, which was not what it looked like the night before, which got my anxiety up.

Today it's spread a bit and now a dark red, turning purple ish and I noticed I have a lot of spider viens in that area. 

I'm so scared it's a blood clot or something worse. Should I wait and monitor it or go to doctor? I've been working with my therapist, that one symptom doesn't make it true, but I'm really freaking out. Is this normal for a Bruise?

"Upper Neck/ Spine Pain Anxiety So I've been diagnosed with GAD and I'm a senior in college so I've had unbelievably high stress and anxiety levels lately because of my impending graduation and uncertain future. Within the past few weeks I've developed this disturbing new symptom where whenever I start to feel anxious or stressed I get this weird pressure feeling in my neck, almost as if it is in my spine and someone is squeezing it. From there, my panic takes over and my heart begins to race, my stomach hurts and I feel nauseous, I get a tension headache, and I feel all wound up and ready to flee. My upper neck and shoulder muscles have been incredibly tight lately, so rationally I'm sure this spinal feeling is just a result of muscle tension and anxiety, as well as the crappy dorm mattress and my poor posture. However, I've convinced myself I have a brain tumor or am going to develop epilepsy or something. Dr. Google certainly didn't help because I Googled symptoms of a brain tumor and guess what, I have most of them!

"My Health Anxiety Symptoms Hi Everyone! 

As someone who has been struggling with health anxiety for the last 4 years, I have found the acknowledgment of potential anxiety symptoms to be the most reassuring form of support. This is not only reassuring to me as it reminds me of all of the different ways anxiety might affect your body, it also reminds me (and hopefully others) that many of these symptoms quickly pass, as they are only manifested *only* as a result of mental illness. 

Here's all of the symptoms that have come and gone as a result of my health anxiety. I hope that people may relate, and be reassured. I've bolded those symptoms which have remained more constant throughout the last 4 years. 

1. tingling extremities 

2. **cold hands and feet**

3. muscle spasms (mostly in leg, thought it was a blood clot, it was not) 

4. **tightness of muscles** particularly around neck and shoulders 

5. dry mouth

6. **bruxism**

7. chest pain, stabbing 

8. **chest pain, dull/achey** 

9. constipation/diarrhea (thought this was hypothyroidism, it wasn't) 

10. hair loss (thought this was PCOS, it wasn't) 

11. Paralysis like symptoms (this came in two ways. One: overthinking things that should be unconscious-- me, thinking about swallowing, resulted in my temporary inability to swallow liquid. Two: mid panic attack, thought I could not move legs. 

12. **pelvic, vaginal/vulva pain** (thought this was vulvar cancer, literally got a chunk cut out of my vulva to test. As soon as results came back negative, the pain stopped)

13. **headaches**

14. **HEADACHES**

15. **pressure in head, tightness** 

16. insomnia 

17. **lethargy**

18. difficulty concentrating 

19. hearing phantom ringing (always hearing my alarm clock, even when it's not going off) 

20. jitters

That is all! (I think). I hope this helped someone, please feel free to ask any questions. ",2

Today I lashed out at him by saying omg dad it’s cuz I’m wearing these pants today ( the pants which are wide, loos high waisted and make ass look bigger), instead of skinny jeans so I obv gained like 10 pounds or tonnes of kilos or whatever overnight. Later on he said “it’s so easy to make you mad you shouldn’t react that way just cus you don’t think you’re fat”  this made me think that he is doing this to get a rise out of me which isn’t cool for 55 yo dad or you know an adult. Or another reason is probably cuz he is getting older and living a sedentary lifestyle, it’s the holiday season and he put on weight he’s not doing anything about it and he’s taking it out on me, he’s a bit chubby but not like overly flabby it’s just most shirts don’t fit anymore.

"I guess some context is in order, I just really feel the need to talk to someone that I do not know. I am a 17yr old male and I have felt this way since I was 8 years old. I remember thinking mid Pokmon battle how much better it would be if I was not alive. 2 almost 3 years ago I was diagnosed with, surprise, major depressive disorder. I tried, I really did, I went to the therapist I took my meds I tried different therapists and even was committed half a year ago for a few days. One of my therapists beloved I also had an anxiety disorder and PTSD, my family never bothered to attempt to have it diagnosed or medicated. I missed one pill and I feel like shit. I count them out and I believe I lost several. Months later my dad tells me he saved some for when I get nervous. All that pain and inadequacy the feelings of worthlessness and me giving up on treatment, all because they took them and hid them for later. Here I am having fucked up once again. I did not mean to hurt anyone I really did not. I did not touch anyone but I know what I did was fucked up and a violation of privacy. It feels like its not me like I am not here. All day every day unless I am playing some stupid fucking game I hate I just feel like someone else. I overdosed on sleeping pills a few months back. I felt scared and confused like my body was not mine, my vision going dark. But now? I want that again, to feel like I am someone else like my issues are fading to black just as my consciousness was. I do not we any to kill myself, not without letting the people I hurt know I did not mean to. I just felt like not myself as though I was someone else just watching. Like my body was on autopilot. I am a fucking liar though. They all think I am a good person and that I graduated this year when I showed up for a month then just stopped and wallowed all day. I am sorry I just do not think I have it in me to be a person. I do not know why I wrote this I just guess I needed someone to talk/vent to. Everythings going to come crashing down and I do not know how what I am doing.",1
"Different Muscle Spasm Sensation While trying to go to sleep last night, I noticed a different type of muscle twitch/spasm in my thigh. I say it's different because any other time I felt a spasm I can see the muscle twitch. It's usually happened in my shoulder/upper arm in past. This one is in my thigh but it feels more like a cellphone vibration that's been coming and going intermittently. I'm a fairly active, muscular guy who's been focusing on running alot. In the past, when I neglect the gym for a few days I've noticed these things happen. I know it's hard to diagnose something like this and I'm most likely overreacting but I've become overly sensitive of new or noticeable indifferences over the years.

You need money and education to have any sort of chance in life. You are better off not even going to college because once your a failure in life it consumes you. in every aspect of life. family wont treat you the same, girls wont even give me a chance once they know. and once you realize this you see life move without you.

"So like I feel like I cannot break and I am trying to sit with the emotions but it quickly keeps shifting negative and almost panicky. I have kind of been under a lot of stress for me since like March so I may be about to burn out too but before you go tell me to see a dr I have no cash, I was in the red but someone paid it and I feel super embarrassed cuz it was my responsibility but I was having a depression episode. And I know part of it was my fault for having hope that something would work but whatever, lesson learned, everything is disappointing. I am also just really stuggle good financial wise and maybe my adhd but basically I am really just struggling and because I may have been gaslighting into not trusting my own experience, can you all just share yours cuz that help point me in a direction (from direct people) and maybe speed up this process.

Eating better and making sure I’m taking care of my body, sleeping good hours and taking my meds but it’s just not worth it anymore. 
Im so disgusted in myself, im so disgusted that I don’t want to keep fighting for everyone I love. I don’t want my family and friends to experience me just leaving, I don’t want to put that pain on them. I don’t want my little sister to grow up without me, I don’t want her to not understand why I don’t come to visit her anymore.

"I did the best I have ever done yesterday. I brushed my teeth, took a shower, meditated for 20 whole minutes, walked for almost an hour, made a schedule for myself, morning, nightly and weekly. I did all the things I set out to do.But around early evening things took a turn for the worst. The nukes began dropping in my head. You cannot stay like this, you will never achieve anything, you are not worthy of love, you are not even worthy of being acknowledged, you are a pointless enigma, you are hopeless, you will never be anything more than a failure, you cannot get it right, you will fall, you should just end this, give up, no one could ever love you, just end this, you cannot escape the pain, you cannot deny reality, you cannot do anything, you should just end this.Combined with the siphoning of the worth of my deeds, how pathetic my attempts were in reality, the pressure inside my head, my heart like a sack of stones. it is been present now for about 6 hours. I did manage to get myself to sleep for about 7 hours in there.But as soon as I awoke, those thoughts were right there, the heaviness in my chest, this overwhelming sense that I just cannot escape reality. That I have lost everything and I will always be bound to lose whatever I try to build.I try to remember my therapy tools. I try to just breathe, acknowledge how bad it hurts and just let it be. Try not to fight it. But it just keeps screaming inside that I am just an empty monster pretending to be human.Seems my depression was more than ready to strike me down. To try to convince me of how hopeless the remainder of my life truly is. All the things I have been forced to miss, things I cannot let go of. My children. How I failed them. All of this pain, all of the regrets, all of that loss. Just more nuclear bombs going off inside my mind. In all of it I wish I could just scream but I cannot. I wish I could cry but I cannot. The pain is so total, the destruction of my mind seemingly complete. As the fallout begins to rain down. I want to believe, this seperate entity from my mind, this ""me"". The fractures and fault lines seem to vast to repair. In all of it, I suppose I should at least be grateful that I have therapy in about 4 hours.Though I am not sure what I am really doing beyond wasting my therapist's time. It all feels so inevitable and I try to convince myself it will pass. I try to say maybe it is not as bad as my mind is making it out to be. I try to fight this war through kindness but I feel I am failing, just as I always have done. I can(t)",1
"It feels like everything is just a blur now. it is there and then it is gone like it is nothing. It feels never-ending and way too short at the same time. I have not felt like this until the last 2 years. I have dealt with depression for as long as I can remember, but it is never been this bad. It really sucks cus I feel like I cannot truly appreciate the time I have with others. I have been suffering for a long time. I have honestly given up at this point, and the only reason I still try to push myself and progress is for other people. I know I need to love myself and treat myself better, I am trying, really. I have been trying, but I have never tried so hard in my life. it is so hard. I only ever talk to 4 people, which I do not have a problem with at all, but despite having these people in my life, I feel so alone in this world. Not the sense of loneliness in my room late at night, or loneliness from lack of love or affection, but just this lonely feeling. I feel so much pain and yet I feel nothing at the same time. I do not know what to do, and I do not know why I am posting this really. I have been trying to keep it to myself. When it gets bad I hold the gun in my hand, look at it, and just think. I do not know exactly what I am thinking in those moments, there is so much running through my head. I wonder, if there was no one on this earth I loved or cared for, would I be able to do it? There are so many beautiful things in life but this dark cloud takes over and distorts my vision, almost literally. It feels like it controls all of my body. I am not sure how to explain it.

I have to drive him there tomorrow and I do not even know if I can get an appointment. Not only that, but I am so tight on money, I am barely getting by and this surgery is going to cost more than I have in my bank account...

I have no one to ask, except for my mum and she also probably will say no. I got so dizzy hearing the diagnosis, that I got an anxiety attack and had to leave the clinic to cool down. My mom acted like I was super ungrateful to her, because I left her with the doctor and the dog until I could catch my breath. Fuck...

"Anxiety? Stress? Guilt? Scarred? I’ll try to cut my story short in hope of someone out there being able to help me and guide me as I feel like I can no longer continue living with this feeling.

A general idea about myself is that I am a 22 yrs old medical student. I usually stress and worry a lot about medical school and my examinations, regardless of the fact that I score the highest amongst my batch. 

My story starts the summer of 2021 where I met a girl that goes to the same medical school as I do. Half way through the relationship problems start to arise between the two of us and I didn’t think anything of them as all relationships have their ups and downs. At this time, my partner began to say bad and mean things to me when we fought which initially didn’t affect me as I knew it was because of her being angry (she also reassured me after the fight resolves that she didn’t mean it). This started to escalate in which the problems became more frequent and almost every time I’ve had hurtful things being said to me. This progressively increased till the summer of 2022 (~11 months past for our relationship) which was the same summer in which I would take my Step 1 exam (a really important, exhausting and dreadful exam). At this point I used to always worry about our future and if were are even compatible, I used to have a weird heart clenching feeling that is filled with worry and anxiety, I also used to wake up from sleep several times with my heart racing or wake up before my alarm with the thought of our relationship overwhelming. We had a fight around 3 weeks before my exam which was my last straw and I communicated to my partner at that time that I want to end things as I felt I should communicate to her my true feelings that I no longer feel like I can continue in this relationship or think we have a future together (the things that were said to me where the worse out of all fights). She was devastated, cried and begged for me to give her another chance as she will change herself. I was heistant but decided to give her a chance, it worked out for the first few days but then the same heart clenching weird anxious feeling returned. I tried to battle it and not disclose it to her, but eventually I couldn’t hide it anymore and told her I couldn’t accept and give her another chance (around ~4 days before my exam). The whole 4 days and holiday after the exam was devastating I was really sad and down. With time, I used to distract myself and go out with friends (I don’t drink) almost every other day which helped me try to forget the whole situation. 

Keep in mind that I’ve got several messages from my ex weeks after the breakup about how I was wrong and that she would never forgive me and other prayers. Similarly over the last couple of months (it’s been 6 months since our breakup) I’ve been getting tiktok reposts from her account of videos taking about injustice and how sad/devastated she was which always made me feel very guilty as I was the reason for her current feelings. Similarly, it made me self-conscious about my decisions and doubt my feelings as she claims I never loved her and if I did I would never leave her.

Fast forward to the last month (5 months since breakup) where I finally approached a girl in my class that was always getting my attention and I couldn’t lay my eyes off her. In the first 3 days (through text), I was very happy and excited to get to know her. Three days later (which was also when the new school year started and the week of my important sport tournament) I started to have this same tiring, coruscating and exhaustive heart clenching feeling as if there is something I am worrying about. It started to increase progressively and I’ve always tried to forget it and keep it in the back of my head,, but it has been really taking a toll on me as I almost wake up everyday with this feeling and it stays throughout the day. Keeping in mind that throughout this period we’ve grown really close and she seems to really care about me. I have this feeling in the background around 60% of the day, 20% is me being distracted by work and friends and the remainder 20% consist of me actually overthinking and worrying. I really don’t understand why is this happening:
	a. Am I feeling guilty that I am meeting a new person?
	b. Am I worrying that this new relationship may end like the previous one?
	c. Am I scarred and no longer can commit to a relationship? 
	d. Why is the same feeling (but less intensity) that I was having before I left my ex happening again????
	e. Is the person not compatible for me and I am still seeking my ex?
	f. Did I still not move on from my previous relationship (prior to the new girl I was certain that I did move on and had 0 feelings, but I brought it up now because I have 		no idea what is the reason for this feeling)

Any input can help me understand this feeling that is taking a huge toll on me.

"I am 34 weeks pregnant. I have started taking sertraline for my boarderline personality disorder, they primarily wanted me taking it because I have manic depression as well and my doctors are concerned about post partum. Well today I had my pre admit for the hospital, I have barely been on these for a week, but they told me that my baby would likely experience withdrawal once born. I am not sure I want to put it through that, but at the same time they are saying that the benefits for my well being outweigh the risk put on my baby. My SO says he supports me on whatever I choose to do and that he thinks it is best if I take them personally because my moods have been so all over. I constantly feel like I am drowning lately, I know it is not just me, it is my family, they are inconsiderate and its getting to me. I really just need some TLC, I need to feel like they care. It does not feel like they do, I am simply here to make everything convenient for them and now I am in a position where they are taking more than I can give. I have had suicidal ideaology for the better part of my life, since I can remember I have romanticized dying. Only because that means the pain would end. I sound dramatic, but I had a very traumatic childhood and I have never had a chance to recover, or the support I need. I am tired though, this new doctor has narrowed it down, he hit the nail on the head with his diagnosis I think, which was boarderline personality disorder, manic depression, anxiety disorder as well as PTSD. Honestly it all makes sense, my moods, my behaviour, everything. Now it is just figuring out how to stop it so I can be the best version of myself for my littles and not fuck them up. So the medication was where he wanted to start, and then he referred me to a few different therapists, one for DBT therapy, and trauma groups, and then just normal therapy. I am scared though, I do not want to hurt my baby. But I am hurting. I guess I just needed to get it out, I feel like a bad person for needing this shit, I wish I could just be normal.

"Some advice to my people Hello,

I've been suffering with anxiety and panic attacks my whole life, and while I take a ridiculous amount of meds for it including lorazapam, pregablin etc, I was informed about Magnesium and I wanted to share this with you.

So a lot of us get anxiety attacks triggered by the stress hormone cortisol, magnesium works by by stimulating the production of melatonin and serotonin which boost your mood and help you sleep. Magnesium also reduces the production of cytokines and cortisol, which lead to increased inflammation and stress.

It's important that you don't over do it as you can poison yourself with magnesium, and you also have to make sure it's aspartate, citrate, lactate, and chloride forms as oxide apparently doesn't absorb as well.

Speak to your pharmacist or Dr if you're mixing medication, but I have been able to reduce the amount of lorazapam I've needed since starting mag and its helped a lot with sleep. I'm truly impressed.",2

"I have recently looked into reddit and found that this place is actually quite healthy and supportive... I did not know this place really existed... but anyways I have very little motivation to work my way up the employment ladder whether its for a career or min wage job... as I feel so very few careers are really interested in helping people. I am an out of the box thinker and I know most jobs will slice my head if I try quacking about maybe we can serve people first and then profit second...I do not think I have much to say, but I look very young for 26 and it seems that is a turn off for most girls. I initially tried being a psych communications major in college but dropped out as someone in a way handed me a red pill. Since about 6 years ago since that happened, I have been studying different sources on the internet to help me perform at my best if there ever was an opportunity that did not require a degree. But I have little faith and try to make creations and upload maybe assist others in some meaningful way and also make a return. ANYWAYYYSSSSSS I know my story does not sound so bad and I think a big chunk of life is how we perceive things versus how they actually are. I do not have a motivation to get a car or a job because my god mother pays for the rent and allows me free time to make creations, but I do not have a circle of friends that is interested in what I have to share. So I am wondering how I can make money with my stuff without paying for ads or self-promoting. I have asked myself how can I honestly make connections if I do not promote? Some people say offer your work for free and I do offer some stuff for free, but it is quite impersonal type of work and people these days are looking to eat up as much emotion as they can in order to fuel a like or a subscribe reaction. For some reason, I try to stay as impersonal as possible with all my work and it seems to kind of work against me in this type of culture. I am not very attached to specific beliefs or ideas.... so it seems like that is a free ticket for capitalism to rape me.... if this is my destiny.... then what can I do? I have thought about dying voluntarily from malnutrition going out into a rural area and just letting go from there.... but that would be a tough way to go it seems but that could also be a perception. I am not very suicidal to be honest but it comes up. But anyways, I do not really ever share this stuff and I am sorry if it sounds like I am messed up. I am not going to get help if you think I need it. I consider myself kind of an anti-capitalist/materialist but do like small talk and jokes... if anyone of any gender would like to talk and maybe become friends or just talk for a short while without small talk, you would not be ghosted. End: I really do not like how our problems in society are so obvious and yet people play fucking dumb when realizing when someone is having issues... they must be really fucking hurting if they are playing that low... there must be another level of empathy above where I am at if I cannot see that these people are actually hurting inside, but they do a good damn job of putting a smile on their face and saying another day another dollar.

"I created CocoonWeaver to help. It’s a free, privacy focused app that sorts audio recordings, transcribed, into categories. There are numerous benefits to self talk, in particular it can decompress mental states and reduce stress. I hope you enjoy! Sometimes, it’s overwhelming to think about all the stressful things. When you let go of them, you can take solace in the fact they remain in a safe space, but no longer occupying headspace. I developed CocoonWeaver because of a dream I had. My dream was about an app that would be intuitive enough to release the many fleeting thoughts that occupy ones mind. Since then, it has been developed in to a working product, and improved with the help of kind feedback from various neurodivergent communities. I would love to take feedback from this community as well, if you have a moment to download the app and share your feedback I would be extremely grateful. 

The app is completely free and it is completely private, nothing leaves your device and everything is stored on your phone.

Thank you so much for your time! &lt;3

"Bust the stigma, don't whine but be frank, if you know or someone else that is struggling help the best you can, constantly let others know that yes they will not drown, there is a boat, and it fits way more than one person. The reality is the more you own and verbalize things, the more control you have over it and the less over you. Bottom line is busting the stigma, no one should feel like they are alone. So does my short little list work for everyone, totally not but I think it is a good reminder for people like myself..and hopefully someone else can take something away from it. If anything it's just got for me to verbalize it all out once in awhile.",0

My husband had several things happen to him when he was a teenager and occasionally when things get very bad for him he has very bad flashbacks complete with regression to the time when the trauma happened. It is heartbreaking to see, and obviously he does not recognize me and does not understand why we live together and why he’s not living at his parents house Does anyone have experience with this kind of flashbacks?

"i’m scared that i’ll get depressed again in summer i’ve had depression for five years now. and i’ll just say that last summer was the worst. a lot of shitty things happened but long story short, i moved to a new city (a new country actually, so no family too) for college all by myself and was alone for a solid two months. my depression really hit rock bottom. i was so unstable and just… unwell. the only thing i looked forward to was talking to my therapist, who btw ended up being incredibly irresponsible. 

i’m now surrounded by lovely people but they’re all leaving the city for summer break. i can’t stop worrying that i’ll become depressed again. my plan for now is to take summer courses and pick up a campus job (e.g. working at the library). perhaps i’ll pick up a casual part-time job as well. i just want to make sure that i keep myself busy. last summer was tough cause i didn’t have the means to meet people and interact, and i’m hoping this time it’ll be different if i put myself out there. honestly though, i just can’t help but worry a lot. depression is my worst enemy and it lives inside me. at this point, i can’t let it fucking win again. 

i think of warm sunlight but instead of warmth i feel this intense sorrow. i want this to change. i want this summer to be a good time.",1
"My anxiety is ruining my personal relationships Recently I got a fairly nice gift for a friend's birthday (\~$40 worth) which isn't an extravagant gift, but definitely the nicest gift I've given in this particular friend-group. I was really excited about this gift because I thought it was a good fit for this person. Unfortunately, my excitement for giving this gift turned to anxiety as I became concerned about how such a (relatively) nice gift might be perceived being given to a friend of the opposite sex.... I REALIZE THIS IS COMPLETELY IRRATIONAL.... as most of my anxiety is.

So this became a trigger for a multi-week bout of extremely high anxiety and this person definitely realized that they were the trigger for it one way or another......... and now it seems like they are at the point that they are starting to get a little freaked out and I'm afraid of losing one of my closest friends. 

I feel the need to apologize or explain..... for making them feel so horrible, but how can you explain this. I'm afraid that talking to them about it will just make it more awkward. Our recent interactions have been cold and awkward. I don't know what to do now.",2

"The last time I made a real friend was in the 1st grade. I do not mean irl, either. I mean a friend as in someone I can be myself around and feel that they want to keep engaging with me. The last of my real friendships fizzled out before I was 15. I grew up sheltered from the hardships of life, but at the same time, I was stunted from growth because the only person I could learn from was an abusive alcoholic older brother. He kept me alive, but prevented me from learning how to be normal. So I retreated as far as I could, to the point where it got physical. In the last years of middle school, I stopped applying myself in school, doing nothing with my time except reading or being absent-minded. After my first year of highschool, at the age of 17, I ran away. I took a bus to my hometown and tried to reconnect with old friends. I had fun for a few months, and I learned a lot of essential things both about myself and about the real world. Then, as suddenly as it began, it ended. I had burned any bridge that could keep me where I wanted to be.I called my brother, begged forgiveness, and came back to him. He had not changed at all. It clashed violently with my newfound outlook on life, and his abuse reached an all-time high for the remainder of my 17th and 18th years on Earth. My depression came back, but I did not retreat. I fought back, mentally and physically. Eventually the abuse stopped completely. I do not know why really. But I was left in a position where my brother was my life-source, and at the same time, I did everything in my power to not engage with him.I am 23 now. I have been in the same position since then. In the handful of years past, I have tried to spark relationships with other people. Both irl and online, platonic and romantic. However, I cannot make anything work. I am fundamentally broken with no fix in sight. The only person who has expressed a want to help me is my little sister, and I cannot even bring myself to tell her what is wrong with me. I cannot fucking talk to people. I cannot look people in the eyes. I cannot feel empathy. I write this with the full expectation that it will gather no attention. I have a burn in my mind. It throbs with pain, easily dulled with distractions, but never healing. I want to feel normal. I feel like I have got a permanent burn.",1

I am jealous of people that have issues with their spouses because at least they have/had the capacity to develop a relationship in the first place. I do not necessarily want to die, but I refuse to live the rest of my life like this. There just does not seem to be a light at the end of the tunnel.

"I thought if I post this here it may help someone who has not already heard this analogy. it is really simple but counsellors and therapists have shared this with me in the past. I think it helped me visualise how anxiety and depression affects a person's ability to function and face the challenges of life and explain it to others: 1. Take two cups and fill the first with a little bit of water, and the second half full.2. The first cup is a 'normal person', the second is someone who suffers with a mental health condition like anxiety, 3. For all of life's stresses - work stress, financial worries, family issues, health problems, having a bad day etc. - add a little water to each glass. do not stop pouring.4. Obviously, the second glass will begin to overflow first. If it is knocked, the contents will be more likely to spill the fuller the glasses are.5. For many people who have silent struggles affecting their mental OR physical health, their cup is already pretty full at their baseline.6. It does not take a lot for this cup to overflow or spill compared to others, but that does not mean the cup is completely incapable of holding any water.7. It might be necessary to make a few holes in the bottom of that cup to stop the cup from overflowing. Cup Analogy",1

Especially my perception of other people. I take everything personally and assume its everyone against me. I am tired right now, but it is 3 AM after all.

"I have been having anxiety and depression since ~5 years. I somehow managed to live with it. Last year, with covid, my depression got really worse. And this year, since a few months, its even worse. I have no friends, like, absolutely no friends. No one ever send me messages to have news from me, no one gives a shit about me. I could be dead, they would not notice. I have thought about talking about it to my family but it would just worry them, and I do not want them to feel bad because of me. I also do not want them to think I am crazy, I am not, I am just desperately alone. I do not think I will ever be capable to commit suicide, but lately I have been thinking about how would people react if I was dead. Would they suddenly care about me ? For the first time in my life I am having suicidal thoughts",1

"Mono nightmare Towards the beginning of 2019 I began feeling something weird in my throat, as if a ball of mucus was stuck there. I thought it was allergies but never took any allergy medication. Fast forward to 1 week ago where I'm following a terrible flipped sleep schedule going to sleep at 10am and waking up at 6pm. I woke up at 4pm one day and was so tired that I ended up falling asleep at 10pm. After getting 9 hours of sleep I still remained tired throughout the day. I assumed it was due to my sudden shift in sleep schedules but the daytime fatigue continued. Eventually, I scheduled a physical exam to see what was going on, all while assuming the absolute worst case scenario. The doctor brought up mono as a possibility but I didn't think much of it.

&amp;#x200B;

Again fast forward to today, I receive a call from the doctor saying that my bloodwork came back positive for mono. I was shocked. But for some reason, I've been having a heart/chest pain that pops up for a few seconds at different times throughout the day and almost as it were to perfectly coincide with my diagnosis. Now there are some complications with mono such as heart inflammation however they are said to be quite rare. My hypochondria is immediately assuming that I am one of those rare cases and have developed a viral heart disease. Does anyone have an experience similar to this with mono? I would love to hear about it. ",2

"Stain on neck I noticed something on my neck about a month ago. It looks like a pimple what seemed to be a yellow bruise down below it. I then forgot about it because I then started worrying if I had colon cancer because my stomach would make noises non stop. After my stomach issues cleared up by themselves I noticed my neck and the stain got darker and a bit bigger. For the past week or so I’ve been constantly looking up melanoma and now I feel like I have it. I’ve been obsessing, taking 50 pictures a day of my neck, crying, it able to eat properly, feeling like I’m going to faint, shaking, and not being able to be happy with my wife and daughter. I spoke to a virtual doctor and said I should get tested to see if it is melanoma and I’ve been crying and worrying all day. I feel like I’m going insane and the thoughts of suicide have crossed my mind at least once because the thought of leaving my wife and daughter behind and the fact that I’m only 26 scares me so much. I want to grow old with my wife and thinking that I might die so scares me so much. I’m going to an actual doctor tomorrow and I can’t handle it. I don’t know how I’m going to be like at work. I constantly keep googling and once I start I can’t stop. I feel like I have melanoma and it’s already to late because it might be advanced. I’m scared and all I want to do is cry and not move.

However, its not a precise retelling,  partially for my safety, but also because I want to tell not just my story but others' stories as well. Part of what makes good writing is having small specific details and the little stories that make up the novel as a whole. This is why I was hoping that, if you are interested, you could send me stories of your experiences in an abusive relationship - whatever detail you choose to send, it doesn't have to be anything ""epic"" and ""grand,"" it could be the smallest segment that you hold significance to.

"Issue with Anxiety and Throat Hey guys, 

First time posting but been dealing with anxiety for a while... A lot of my anxiety goes to my health... 3 years ago I began to have these extremely painful sores in the back of my throat. Went to a bunch of doctors and they couldn't tell me what was happening (they said it was stress). I also got oral thrush in my throat and mouth along with headaches, stomach aches, flu and cold symptoms. I began to get extremely anxious with everything that I spiraled out of control. I landed myself in a psychiatric hospital by the end. I almost lost my job, my wife, and my life because of it. Turned out I wasn't crazy but was having an adverse reaction pyhsical and mental to mold in our apartment we had recently moved  into before my symptoms popped up. Every thing gradually got better, my anxiety went way down... my health returned....But the one side effect was my throat became extremely sensitive. It easly scratches and a white scab will form while it heals. But my anxiety self that pops up during this time will freak out and go into PTSD mode remembering all the bad memories. I impulsively have to check my throat  and look at any injuries a lot during the day and even sometimes take a Q-tip and touch the area and see if the scab come off just to make sure it isn't one of those sores like before. 

Anyway I just wanted to know if anyone has gone through something similar and of anyone has some coping techniques that might help (yes I see a therapist and whatnot as well). Getting sick or feeling like I'm getting sick extremely stresses me out as well because of these issues. 

Thanks everyone!",2

Temporary solutions to numb this until I can get proper care? How do you get through the day like this I have a great job and a potential promotion happening very soon but everything else outside my career is so sad right now.

My relationship is basically over my grandfather is dying in hospice with bone cancer and I’m slowly feeling like I’m spiraling even worse than before. I have to hide it from everyone in my life because everyone has something else more important going on.

"I have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, though i am not sure if i ever actually had it. I had a couple years where i was on a lot of drugs, both prescription and non prescription, which caused severe depression, but i know that was just because the drugs were screwing with my brain (specifically opioids and antidepressants). It majorly improved once i was off them. I know that i have anxiety, and many social issues (possibly autism). But when i really look at it, basically every time i was depressed it was because i was obsessively worrying or terrified of something/someone, or overthinking about a past experience. I am able to pull myself out of these depressive episodes with change of environment, except for the time it was caused by the drugs and on the unusual occasion when something really bad happens. From what i understand, people with major depressive disorder are not able to do that very easily, or at all. I am starting to believe i never had true major depression, but depressive symptoms from other issues such as the anxiety, social issues or past trauma, along with just being in a bad environment and/or with bad people. I do not think that my negative feelings about life and the world are irrational or caused by depression, i am just naturally pessimistic and have still been able to feel better without changing that (i have no desire to, i am perfectly fine with being a pessimist..i actually felt worse when i was trying to be more optimistic). Maybe the reason treatments have never worked is because they are just treating a symptom and not the real issue? Can depression just be a symptom of another condition? I am questioning if i ever had depression at all",1
"For example, she once tried to stab her mum's boyfriend because she didn't want her mum to be with anyone - they were in their mid 60s.

I'm concerned because she found out last night that he is seeing this ex gf of his. He doesn't know how she found out - he's kept it very, very private. She came back to the house they used to share (he was there with their kids in bed while she had been out) and lost it with him.",3

But, I am the one who is depressed. I am the one who is anxious. I am the one who cannot make friends because it pains me to talk to people. I am the one who barely does anything but sit in my room and write and read. My parents have done a lot for me, they always try to help with my mental health, even if they do not understand it, but I wonder sometimes if they are embarrassed of me. I wonder if my sister or my brother is embarrassed of me. I wonder if they all get tried of me asking about small, stupid things because I am terrified about them. I wonder if they get tried of me looking so sad all the time or barely hanging out with anybody. I wonder if when someone asks about me, my parents do not talk about me because who would want to talk about a depressed kid? Anytime I try to speak up and ask for some comfort on something, I feel like my parents are just tired of me. Over the past year, I have been getting better at being able to speak up when worried, but it seems as if they are irritated and upset with me for asking for comfort so much over such stupid things. In my head, they are big and suffering and keep me up at night, but my parents always tell me that I cannot let those kind of things control me. I am trying. I am really trying. But sometimes I just need someone to tell me it is going to be okay, you know? I am worried they all think of me as an embarrassment. I am worried they are getting tired of my questions and my worries. I am just worried that being like this makes me embarrassing. Am I something to be ashamed of? Should I be ashamed? Should I have the strength to work it out on my own? Am I an embarrassment?",1

"Good evening all. 2 Mondays ago I went to the ER for a kidney stone. Went on to work afterwards and everything was ok. That next morning my side was hurting from it so I took one of the Percocets they prescribed me, took off work, and went back to bed. My daughter sleeps with my wife and I and she sbuggked up with me (she is 2 1/2 years old) and I had a dream that I hurt her somehow. When I woke up the first thing I thought was oh my god, I could never do that. Since then, I have been incredibly disconnected from life. I stopped taking them officially this last Sunday so they have been out of my system for about a week. But, the depression is still here and I have never experienced it before in my life. I feel weird around my wife and daughter. I have thought about just driving my car into a tree as fast as I can to make it all go away. I feel like I do not love anyone anymore and nothing seems to bring me enjoyment. All I sit and think about is when is this all going to go away? And days JUST DRAG ON now. I am barely eating and barely sleeping. I mentioned the Percocets because I have been told this is classic Percocet deoendabxy withdrawal and just how easy it is to become addicted to them with a regular week dosage from the Dr. But, I cannot seem to move past this. I have managed to keep the dark thoughts out but my enjoyment is gone. I laugh at jokes sure. But.... I am absolutely lost. it is as if I look at my wife and daughter and wonder who they are.

"Working out worsening my anxiety Hey all,

I'll try to make my story as quick as possible. I've been working out for about 9 year now. I've battled forms of anxiety and depression my whole life. My health anxiety has been at an all time worst this past month. About a month and a half ago I took performance enhancing drugs (PEDS). I stopped cold turkey after taking them for 12 days cause I saw some symptoms I didn't like. Ever since I've stopped, my panics and anxiety have been killing me. My biggest fear is that I screwed up my heart just from those 12 days. 

I don't really fear anything else except for heart issues. I haven't been able to sleep since I've been in fear. I went to my doctor and she gave me all the physical tests (took my blood pressure, listened to my heart/breathing and checked my limbs for swelling) and she said everything seemed fine.

Yesterday I returned to the gym and working out makes me so nervous. I keep thinking any type of physical exertion is gonna cause my heart to stop. One symptom I've noticed is that I feel a weird bubbly feeling stemming from my upper left abdomen, sort of where my chest meets my stomach and it feels like a weird pressure/bubble rising through my stomach/chest and throat on the left side. It's almost like I have to burp but can't. I noticed its been happening and its mostly when I workout. I'm super scared that I have AFib. Hoping this is just anxiety related or stomach related. 

I've been doing so much googling lately that I've come up with about 50 different possibilities of what it could be lol.",2

I cannot take it anymore... I cannot enjoy anything except gaming and my ps4 died this morning so I am disgusted and if you are wondering, I am a boy, I am 16 so I am in the middle of puberty but I am probably sterile because my bullying in primary school made people hit me in the balls to sterilise me so I do not have a sex drive so sexual pleasure is absent so if you are wondering, sex does not give me pleasure (plus I am traumatized by it...)

I have been in college since 2016, and I have had to retake multiple classes. I will be taking biology for the 4th time due to having to withdraw due to covid and having emergency surgery a few semesters ago. I am also still in remedial math and cannot even do math at a sixth-grade level. I also have a mild disability, and I am afraid that it will prevent me from becoming a vet. I am not in a rush to finish college, but I cannot help and feel as though I will be judged for it. I do not want to keep blaming my depression for my failures in life. Still, they are certainly a significant factor in it. I wish that society would understand how draining college can be. Struggling to find motivation in college",1

"I feel like there is something fundamentally broken with me.*Everyone* told me that after high school I would feel better. I do not think I have ever felt worse in my entire life than I do right now. I have no passions, no aspirations, I do not like doing anything and I have no idea of what to study in university/college. But I *have to* because it is not like I can get myself a decent job if I start crying everytime someone looks at me in public. Between depression and social anxiety my will to live or do anything is pretty much negative. My parents keep yelling at me because finishing high school did not magically cure me. Honestly I hate existing, I hate existing with every single fiber of my being. I feel like shit everyday and people keep telling me to ""appreciate the small things"" as if thinking that a sunset is pretty for 3 seconds will make up for the fact that I have been crying myself to sleep for the past 2 years. fuck you. I am starting to despise my parents for the sole fact that they are the reason I exist, I wish I could go back in time and prevent them from meeting or something. I hate existing so much. I have not even been through trauma or anything my brain is just broken. Everything keeps getting worse and I keep going to sleep hoping I do not wake up just to be disappointed the morning after. I am just so tired.I feel like I lack whatever people have that keeps people going. I have no motivation to do anything, not even things that could improve my situation. It does not help that my parents keep yelling at me over the fact that I am always home because they do not understand that I simply do not like going out with friends. I do not. Everytime I go out I am bored for 4 hours then go back home just to say that I was not home wasting my time.there is something wrong with me. I do not like anything of what I should like. I do not like anytthing actually, how can I keep living like this? And why? I am not suicidal but I think the only reason that I am still here is that I would feel guilty leaving my parents with the pain of losing their only daughter... and the fact that I am really afraid of death and what comes after. I cannot win. I cannot even find comfort in the thought of being dead. I hate how the more I grow up, the more responsabilities I have. I did not even want to be born in the first place and now I have to study then work until I die. I hate everything.I do not know If I am depressed because I hate existing or I hate existing because I am depressed.(Sorry if this is rambly, I am having the worst existential crisis of my life as I am typing this) (And before you ask: yes, I am seeing a therapist.

I thought burning out at work is the reason of me feeling this way. I took a week off from work thinking Id be back refreshed. But it did not help, instead all I did was stay home and watch tv.

"The Rollercoaster ride of anxiety. Starts off slow, maybe you don't notice then eventually starts going up and no matter how hard I try to meditate, mindfulness and it slowly goes up until it peaks and I crash down.  Then I'm okay for a day, a week, and start climbing again.

"It makes me laugh, in a half-shocked-half-depressed kind of way, that the common discourse around depression is still that it is an individual problem.For when the way that we live is so drastically different from how we evolved, it is not hard to see why our minds may create some friction. We live disconnected from anything meaningful: work, relationships, nature, but above all, meaning itself. Anyone who refuses to accept that the meaning of life is to work for money and possessions is sick in the head, disturbed, mentally ill.Your body uses pain to tell you that your current situation is dangerously off. Then, is depression not your mind telling you that something needs to change? And if so, how sick is it to try to change the mind itself, to try to convince it that no, pain is actually fine, there is nothing wrong. Our minds are trying to tell us that we are not meant to live this way, that there IS something greater to experience in life than sleepwalking through every dull day, collecting our checks so that we can pretend to have fun for a few hours each weekend. Our minds are trying to get us outside, into nature, to find friends and do real, meaningful activities with them, to get away from all the stress, anger, and jealousy of the cities and return to how we were meant to live. A simple life, with meaningful work, meaningful goals, meaningful friendships, but above all, a way to find meaning in every action, to feel like there is a reason to live.There is something better. We do not have to live like this. We are not meant to live like this",1

Obviously big mistake but even then felt fine for a month or so.

I chose to quit because I just knew I wouldn’t go long without a job.

New year, new hiring season, but I’m still here…in my room…applying for jobs…almost 50-100 applications sent a week, but because I’m not specialized in anything, I have to wait for handouts.

When I eat my stomach hurts, but when I dont eat my stomach hurts and I feel close to fainting. I can’t sleep, I’ve been staying up til like 1-2am just…applying. I literally have nothing better to do. No money to spend so I can’t go anywhere. Me and my mom need to go grocery shopping, but both of us are too broke to do so, but we make too much for food stamps and I was denied unemployment.

I tried to smoke the stress away, but that only caused me to feel like I need it so I don’t lose my mind being a manic freak. 

I try to play my video games, but when you’ve been literally raised by the internet and have probably seen everything of interest, it’s just boring.

"Friends Is it normal to constantly worry about my actions around my  friends?

I [M] started worrying about whether my friends, or at least my general ones, were just about putting up with me. I feel as if I am unwanted around people I consider friends. Conversations seem to start with being lightly involved ( since I'm present at the start) and seem to be directed at other people, say I was with 2 others they would talk between themselves. 
I may be overreacting which is probably the case but it seems when playing football during breaks at school, I seem in no way involved like my other friends are.
People I like as friends seem to disregard me in most things, for example if I had a group project of some description with groups of 6, I seem to be the 7th person constantly.

I also feel that I do not want to let go of my friendships, how rough it may be on me, due to me having no other people to turn with.
I don't want to be alone, that seems like a bad life to lead but again it appears that sometimes, for others sake not just mine, me distancing myself from them would not be bad.

This does tie into r/stress in a way that I am not myself but the person others want me to be, constantly aware of my actions, hardly any of them I would do of my own accord. It is sometimes tiring.",3

"In the past, you all have seen me post about him. I will not mention who HE is just tell you more about what has been going on. I am at an age in my life where, I am trying to simplify my life.

I normally would not care because of that very reason. But, he is not nice about it. I generally keep silent because, I respect my wife. Truthfully, I respect him too. But, lately I am starting to get the feeling he does these annoying little things just because he knows I hate them. He turns off ceiling fans all the time saying that, no one is in the room so, why should they be on? Oh, I see! But, it was alright during the winter months when, YOU left those electric heaters blasting with no one in the room, right? Right before we moved in, his central heat/air shit the bed. None of us could afford to get a new system so, we bought window a/c units. now, in order to cool off the entire house all three units (including the one in HIS room) need to be going full blast at the same time. But, he constantly turns off the a/c claiming he is cold. Maybe he is. But, cannot you put on a fucking sweater until the place cools off awhile? No, he cannot. There is also a doggie door on the back screened in porch which, our dog gets good use out of. When, HE is out there with the cat, he props the fucking door open constantly! it is summer in the south so, the bugs are crazy. Then, he leaves the porch door to the house OPEN so, the bugs get in the house and, the cold air from the living room unit goes right out. Maybe a person would have to be present to understand, the way he does things. It seems like he goes out of his way to be inconsiderate! Then, he hides behind the innocent old man routine. If I say something, it is always like this...he will turn to his daughter and go, I guess I did the wrong thing. Congratulations, you are now the world's oldest martyr. Maybe I make too much out of things but, I suspect I am right about this. I keep silent because, I do not want to start trouble but, it depresses the shit out of me. Thanks for reading my rant.

"so after being seriously depressed for months (to the point of using alcohol to cope) and going through a couple of depressive episodes for at least a year if not longer, coupled with low self esteem and almost if not no self worth for as long ad i can remember, i finally decided i needed to get help. However, i did not have a primary care doctor so i booked an appointment with a pcp to specifically talk about my mental health to talk about actions to take and discuss how I have been feeling. after asking me several assessment questions (again this was the entire point of the visit) she told me she believes i have anxiety and depression and prescribed me low dose zoloft. The first night I had terrible anxiety and could not sleep. last night was a little better but still, i could not sleep. Today was particularly bad. My mind started racing and i was incredibly depressed for about 3 hours after taking it and had some pretty dark thoughts. i was in bed in the dark and that did not help, so i tried watching a funny show and playing video games. not even 10 minutes into both of those activities and i lost interest. i finally decided i needed to do something so i decided to bake and cook dinner. i still felt horrible and i started panicking scared i was just going to continue to be sad and be depressed forever. i sat there worried i had too much time on my hands and i was going to be sad all that time.(i do not have work until later in the day the bext two days) again, still having dark thoughts. after reaching out to a couple people and getting affirmations from them i started saying out loud that i am worthy and that i do not deserve to feel like this and that i will get better and live a long good life. and that it does not matter if everyone else thinks I am worthless, i know i am worthy. i am worthy of getting better. and i will. i repeated this to myself for about 20-30 minutes and it completely lifted my mood. i feel so much better. I am apprehensive to get too excited though because I am worried its just a side effect of the medication (I have only been on it for 3 days) and that it will wear off.

"...but only when you get it.it is becoming more and more frustrating with _anything_ that I do there is always something negative people need to interject with. Never constructive. it is to the point where even small things are bothering me and that is becoming an issue. The biggest thing that gets me are these attitudes of X does it better so you are invalid or Y has it worse so you are invalid. It really makes you feel small and like a nobody.Time and time again I will try something again and it just ends up in the same place. Nobody genuinely cares, which is why I rarely bother anymore to reach out and express things. I am in this alone and just need to deal with it I suppose. When there is nobody to advocate for you, you just need to do it yourself. it is very hard to pick yourself up when you are in a tough spot.Am I letting the negative win? For now yes and I hate that. I really wish things could be different sometimes. Living a happier life will come in time I hope. Thanks for stopping by whoever you may be out there- Positive Reinforcement Goes a Long Way",1

"well, i do not even know how to start this. I am so confused and lonely. just as info I am a 17 y/o female.i have no idea if i even have depression but reading all of your stories, i recognize myself in most of them so i guess I am one of you. I have been experiencing extreme self-hatred for the past 5 years, triggered by a tragic event in my life and then developing rapidly. its like my thoughts are my biggest enemy and I am constantly bringing myself down for the things i do and the way i look.generally, i do not share personal thoughts with people, its actually the first time i am speaking about this. i just ignored it but lately its been getting so troublesome i cannot sleep and I am always in a bad mood. suicidal thoughts have been coming up as well which scares me a lot.furthermore, i just feel apathy towards everything and everyone. yesterday i got my first job offer and i just felt numb. i know I am not worthy and i do not deserve it so i just did not tell anyone about it even if it was an achievement. same thing with good grades, i just do not care anymore. guilt has also been my best friend throughout these years. something happens and then i just put the guilt on myself. its like i know it straightaway even before considering the situation.its just getting worse after every day and i am really lost. thanks for reading and sorry i bothered you with my thoughts. just another depressed buddy here",1

"reccently i read over some messages between me and a previously close friend from a few years ago. during the messages i was going through a depressive episode and we were talking about it together. however, the messages i sent were kind of toxic and i was being very unfair. she was trying to help me and i would reply with k or refuse to say what is wrong because it does not matter. i would also send worrying messages and then not reply for long periods of time, which would make them very anxious. i do not want to be the person i was in those messages, normally i would consider myself to be a kind and friendly person, and id like to think that I have somewhat improved in the last few years, but I have been noticing that during depressive episodes i have a tendency to regress to this blunt and rude way of speaking to people. i know that depression means you cannot feel as much for the other person, and it definitely makes you feel like no one else cares, but i do not want to use it as an excuse and continue to treat my friends badly. a lot of the time i do not even realise I am being like this until afterwards, but I am appalled by how I have acted. i would appreciate if anyone has any tips to get themselves out of the nobody cares about me attitude, or any similar experiences.many thanks my depression makes me into someone i do not like",1

I spent the next few years being extremely reckless and impulsive. My home life was never easy I had an odd relationship with most of my relatives except my mom who was probably the only reason why I am even stable to this day. My brother was always seen as the golden child and me as the problem child so I was constantly shamed by extended family for being so impulsive and reckless which we all know is common signs of PTSD in adolescents. I think my mom was ashamed of my initial assault and though I was able to get help I was never allowed to tell anyone about it and a lot of my extended family I didn't even tell until the last couple of years so this has left a strange dynamic for me of not knowing how I feel about telling people my story but also desperately wanting to share it. In 2011 I finally met my husband who is the only reason I'm even doing as successful as I am today.,3
"Kind of a weird question about stress So, there’s this thing I’ve been dealing with for a while. When my body is under physical stress, or I’m under mental stress, I sometimes get the urge to hiccup. Not a series of hiccups, just one annoying outburst. And I guess I don’t really know if I’d call it a hiccup even. My parents have taken to calling it a “narg” because that’s basically the sound I make during a particularly strong one. Has anyone else ever experienced this before? And is it even really an involuntary stress reaction? It’s been happening for years. I even had an ultrasound on my gallbladder, since my doctors didn’t know what could be causing it. No issues there either. I’d love to hear if anyone has any similar situations.",3

"Holidays have been stressful for me even since I was a child. I have terrible anxiety socializing with anyone, even family. But a few years ago my parents got divorced which made things even worse for me. I now have to split my time between every holiday, even minor ones like 4th of July. This one was supposed to be easy but my parents changed plans last minute of course and I am now so stressed and depressed that is its almost 3pm and I have yet to even get out of bed because the stress is making me depressed and being depressed is crushing every shred of motivation I have. I just wish for once my feelings would be considered even for a minute. Both of my parents are aware that I have severe mental health issues, yet they continue to act like they do not see an issue. I just want to be heard for once. Holidays make me feel terrible",1

She was plainly unhappy with me for not being as communicative anymore, but things really came to a head when I began dating someone. Lisa was the only person in my inner circle of friends to have a poor reaction when I told her I was dating another woman, which was shocking to me because I trusted her, and because she often used social media to convey her allyship with the LGBT community. She often told me that as soon as I met my gf, I quit talking to her (Lisa). As my relationship with my gf became more serious, Lisa and I became even more distant from each other, and she would often ignore my texts or emails (neither of us were ever much for talking on the phone).",0

I have a part time job at the minute and i struggle to keep up with that, i feel so drained and i feel so bad because i know people work more hours than me and work jos 100 times harder than mine, but i still feel like a child, i feel like i have not grown up. I passively want to kill myself, it is a thought that constantly occupies my mind, it is not just when I am at my lowest crying my eyes out, it is constant.I do not know what i need, if its new meds or a higher dosage, i just do not want to feel like this. it is a real struggle to wake up every day and do something. I do not feel like i can pproperly talk to my parents about it, i have a bit of a strange relationship with them both and mental health discussions have never been easy with them. I do not know what to do i feel so angry and filled with hate all the time, I am holding grudges from years ago and I am getting annoyed at the simplest of things.I am supposed to be going to university in September, with the pandemic and my mental health, i really struggled in college this past year, and my grades in one of my subjects very clearly reflect that, I am pretty confident that I am not going to get into my firm uni. I fixated on that, so now I am not sure that I will want to go anywhere else. I don;'t even know if i want to go to university, I am not sure that i even care about the course I have picked. My parents have suggested alternatives such as getting an apprenticeship, but i honestly do not feel ready to grow up, I still feel like a child, I am not ready for the real work.I have so much shit to do, my mum in particular keeps on reminding me of them and i just do not care, i do not feel like I am going to make it to the end of the summer. She said she wishes I would do more to help myself, that hurt.I feel so guilty for feeling like this, I have not suffered in any way to feel like this.

She seemed very distressed talking about it and was almost at the poiint of tears saying that she wishes she knew why it bothers her so much but it does and she can't help it no matter how much she thinks about it or how much I try to explain it to her.

"The title is pretty much what I wanted to ask. That said, I am brand new and have only done one test stream so far. My only steaming goal is to get 4 consistent followers by the end of the year, but right now I am not expecting viewers.I am starting with hidden object games. And all you would need is a discord account and any mic you have.(Laptop, from a phone, web cams mic, anything that works.)I love discussing story, characters, inspirations, and any random topic that might pop up.(It will pop up, my ADHA meds can only do so much.) Other non game related topics are things like food, art/crafting, anime, living with depression and other psychiatric disorders, plants, animals(I have 3 reptiles), fandom, books, and shows. With other stuff you may want to talk about.I am doing this to help me work on my confidence and public speaking, as well as a way to have fun. So it probably will not be seen by many(or any) people, so it is more like us talking over discord with me screen sharing. So it is low pressure and you can have veto power over deleting the stream once over.My schedule is very flexible and I live in the US MDT or GMT-6 time zone. If anyone would be interested, feel free to comment/massage me if you want to talk more about it.

i ve been super depressed this year sure but i don t think it s gon na come yet i remember when i wa young when robin williams killed himself it really shook me because like i understood like my response wasn t being sad necessarily it wa well i get it it s weird i don t know i almost don t even feel emotional saying this one time a couple week ago i wa smoking weed and my heart kind of skipped a beat in a weird way and i thought good i wa like this would be an easy way to solve everything like it would be a relief to die then and there people don t think that right that s weird that i thought that why don t i fantasize about good thing anymore why don t i have oscar acceptance speech in my mirror why don t i think about my dream girl all i ever think about is how hard it ll be to get where i want to be and how i ll probably be when i meet the loml and i ll have no time to do anything fun with her anyway all i ever imagine is the bad stuff i think if you told me that there wa some kind of afterlife that some religion wa right i d do a little research to know what to expect and then probably jump out a window it just make sense right like what am i living for here yeah yeah i have friend and family that love me cool but is that really what s keeping me here guilt that s not a great reason for living and then it just get me it s like am i gon na work for another decade before i can get to a place i wan na be am i gon na be going on 0 by the time i m actually feeling progress in the meantime what the heck happens am i just sad and hurt all the time not worth it i wish i could just learn what my fate wa going to be so i could make an informed decision on whether i should be alive or not i don t know i m not gon na do anything now but like i feel like this isn t normal to think about,1
my other alt account wa deleted so i m posting here today i had a mental breakdown on the basis of what i feel are good thing in my life disappearing inexplicably oftentimes whenever i attempt interaction with aforementioned good thing the last straw wa today over a fairly trivial issue but i broke down because of so many thing that had happened recently in my past that i wa unable to shrug off my life is fairly good and i am very lucky to be living in a household full of opportunity however it feel a though whenever i try to fully indulge in what s provided to me whether it be by my hand or anothers it s normally gone in no time flat about the call i wa in the middle of my breakdown and tried to take the rational course of action calling the hotline because i desperately needed to talk with somebody only to vent my frustration and promptly be hung up on by the person on the other end of the line i tried calling twice more ok case i hung up on then by accident but wa almost immediately disconnected and the last time wasn t able to be connected with anyone fuck what if i were actually about to commit suicide and just wanted someone to talk with only to find out that they didn t care about my problem either it anger me just typing this i m sick of living this way i don t think suicide is the answer but i really just need someone to talk with about my frustration thanks for reading and hopefully your day is better than mine,1
"oh, that's terrible. what does she look like now?",0
"i have asked for her patient while he gets trained, but i understand her not wanting to potentially move into an  environment that disturbers her normal way of life, but thats 6 months from now. I am confident that training would fix 70% of the issues that she has with my dog. Could there be something else deeply underlying that i am missing? To me a loving and healthy relationship is one that can come to compromises and that are no winners or losers, but agreements in place to help solve issues TOGETHER . If she has trouble with compromising on a proper solution now, what will happen when it comes to or much larger life decisions like buying a house or moving to a new city.",0

When I swallow i feel as if i can feel a pulling sensation near the spot where this is happening. It's not exactly giving me a headache but it's disturbing me to which i notice it.",3

hey recently i realised that i ve been having one problem for a couple of year but i wasn t able to identify and name it until now so basically when i talk to someone directly i have no problem in holding eye contact it just feel natural no anxiety at all no matter if it s someone i know or some stranger however i m facing lot of situation when i feel unable to look around like in library where i literally feel some kind of mental block to look at someone sitting beside me or someone passing by sometimes i experience that also in public transport or at the gym i usually try to combat that feeling by looking there anyway but it just feel even more uncomfortable and i feel that this discomfort make me look like some sort of creep how do you even approach such problem,1

Why do I have to make everything so difficult, if I could just decide that is one less problem that I have to deal with. I want to tell him that I am going through some shit right now, but what am I supposed to tell him. Sorry coach my asshole mom's boyfriend broke up with her smashed a bunch of shit, yelled and kicked her and I just sat in my room like a pussy. Then to top it off she experienced everything that I do, feeling restless, little to no sleep and always nervous. Then she had the nerve to complain to me about it and get back with him not even a month later. For ten years that man scared me to the point where I did not want to be in the same room as him, and when I finally felt free from worrying about being yelled at or having to hear the dogs get beaten, she pulls him right back into our life, telling me one day I am going to understand. + a bunch of other stupid stuff.

I wanted to see how it would really feel if I died, maybe it is because I do not see so much value in my life, so I wanted someone to give itI honestly do not even know why I am writing this, I am pretty skeptical and I know it will not change or help anything, I kind of just want to go screaming that I am a bastard who wastes a good life like that Why am i genuinely happy when i think/plan to kill myself? even never tried",1

"Possible TW because its about self harm and mental hospitals ig... I really do not know where to ask this so I am asking here, if I missed something in the rules and its not allowed here please tell me! Ok so I am 13F. I was friends with this girl a couple years ago before we moved. Recently her family moved in with us temporarily until they can get on their feet, get a house and such. So its their mom, my old friend (11F), and her brother (9M). I am not really friends with her anymore, and am now more friends with her brother. Since we have become friends I have realized he is most likely depressed (though he has not been diagnosed) and has been occasionally harming himself. Not cutting, but scratching himself with his nails or sharp objects, but that does not make it any less worrying. I am also depressed, (I have been diagnosed, so my parent are aware) and have self harmed (still kind of am). that is one of the reason we became friends, because we could bond over our feelings and opinions. We have a group chat with his sister and had kind of vented there. She got worried apparently and showed our moms. They got really mad at us for talking about that sort of thing. Said it was inappropriate and we should have come to them if we were feeling like that. And his mom said if they were sad, depressed, or self harming that they would be sent to a mental hospital and would not be able to see her for months. No talk about the severity just in general, if they were or were doing any of those things that they would have to go to one.. We ended up getting grounded from our devices because of it. I know her saying that made my friend really anxious and uncomfortable talking about going to somewhere like that.Since then I have heard her say that and things similar to that (some in more detail) to my friend and his sister. I know it always makes him uncomfortable and upset. Idk would she be considered toxic or is she justified in saying stuff like that? (Sorry for the long explanation) Do you guys think my friends mom is being toxic?",1

"Lower back, butt and leg pain due to stress? Has anyone else felt constant back &amp; leg pain (or even general muscle pain on any part of the body due to stress? 

I have never had back problems, ever. Knock on wood, I’ve had no accidents, no sciatic issues, no joint issues, pinched nerve issues or broken bones etc.

That being said, I’ve been undergoing a lot of stress lately. The pain has been building up for a few days but tonight, I’m experiencing increased pain! Feels like the origin is the right side of my lower back and the pain radiates down through my butt cheek into my calf (pain is not travelling to foot). It‘s not a sharp pain. It’s more of a gnawing, dull but steady pain. Feels as if I’ve been punched HARD several times in the said area and I only get a bit of relief if I curl up in my side in the fetal position. 

I found literature online saying that stress can cause these symptoms but I just find it so bizarre. Am I really that fragile thay stress could cause so much havoc? I’m in my 30s. No major health issues. I did have mild covid 1.5 weeks ago though. The only other thing I can think of is the fact that I’ve been sitting a lot due to studying for exams nonstop. Weird because I’ve spent more time sitting and studying in the past, but had no back issues at that time. 

I will be seeing my doc next Monday so I will update the chat but wow this pain is gnarly.",3

"the only reason i have not killed myself is because i believe there is nothing after death and I am afraid that it will not be any sort of peace since you have to exist to feel peace and I am terrified that the last thing I feel will be what i feel for eternity. but all i think about is suicide. I have zero passion or motivation, my brain is a constant fog, i cannot even force myself to move my body half the time, if it were not for my parents i would be homeless in a ditch somewhere. i cut off all my friends and isolated myself, the idea of being around people is unpleasant to the point of excruciating. And terrifying. I am too anxious to be around anyone. I have been self isolated for almost 2 years and I have forgotten how to socialize. I use alcohol sometimes when I am desperate to combat it but now it just makes me feel overall worse. I lost all my creativity. I am too anxious to talk to anyone. I just had an insane freak out outburst of sorts and my dad tried to fight me then all but disowned me. I could not control it and i never can. I feel nothing but guilt, shame, misery, hopelessness and nothingness 24/7. Nothing else. My default is utter despair. I genuinely would be dead if I was not more scared of death than i am a life of torture. Even if it were literal physical torture constantly I would still be too afraid to end it. But I am pretty much already dead. I may as well be. I am a ghost. I cry all the time and when I am not crying its just because I am too empty to. I feel like my brain and my life is ruined. I have sabotaged myself and my relationships and the flicker of a life i almost had because I am weak, pathetic and something in me is fundamentally broken. I just want to die. I cannot focus on anything ever. I get the most rapid mood swings from empty to sad to bored to rage. I get addicted to and abuse any substance I try. I cannot do anything. I shower once every few months. I am posting this so i can focus on something instead of staring at a wall and crying. I do not know why. I know nobody gives a shit. because I sure do not. Fuck it i might as well be dead",1

"For the last year and a half Id say I was self medicating with opiates. (Lots if not so much fun) every day I would wake up and need them. By 48 hours I was puking my guts out. I was not doing your regular boy or H as they say, I was addicted to them round little blue M 30 fentanyl filled disastroids. And I also experimented with some of that G too.

I woke up one day and said fuck it. I am not doing this anymore spent 12 days hurling and had explosive diarrhea. It was hell. But something was missing. I got a sponsor and finally found out why the fuck I was self medicating for so long. Turns out I needed to see a psychiatrist. Long story short I got diagnosed with anxiety and severe depression. Many of my peers and even some family do not believe in my hardships. But I struggle every day just to smile. Even when my child is around. I just wonder when Ill feel better completely.

"I want to start by saying I do not have clinical depression. Everything is just falling apart, and I cannot handle it. My situation is fucking screwed, and when I try to make it better, it seems I only make it worse.I want to die, really. I have wanted to end it all for years, but have been holding on to one thing after the next. Now, I have got a daughter I am trying to be there for. she is the only thing keeping me here at this point.I am in denial about things, and I am like aware of it, but I feel like it is worth being in denial. it is not like I cannot handle the alternative, but I just do not want it. I know that if it comes to it, I will just keep on going, but God damn do I want this.You know, the worst part is I finally set myself up for therapy when I finally hit rock bottom. I am still at rock bottom, but since that day I put in the paperwork/application(last Thursday, today is Wednesday), it can take up to 3 weeks to even get the clinician. I cannot handle what is going on in my head for another two weeks, and then wait to even meet the person, and get fucking help.I started whipping myself with a belt again, which I had not done since 2018. This time, I upgraded to the buckle. My back is incredibly bruised, and sore. But I like looking at it, and I like feeling it in the moment. It makes me feel clear, and like I am being punished for all the fuck ups. I feel like I deserve it. I tried to earlier, but got stopped, because I said something I should not have because I was not thinking.And I am so fucking selfish. Since shit hit the fan, I have been focused on myself instead of what happened(which was to someone else).. But they do not want to talk to me about it, so I am stuck. I ask questions about things that have a concern to me. But this person is the only person I can even ask! I cannot ask someone who does not understand the situation, and I cannot ask the person who does, so what do I do with these feelings and concerns? The only thing I can think of is just punishing myself for even feeling.Fuck, if I could I would go right now and beat the shit out of myself. I am perpetually fucking up. I try to work on things, and then continue to make things worse. I feel like a bull in a China shop, but the bull keeps trying to put the broken plates back on the shelves.

"Weird symptom I've been having that scares me. So for the past year I've been having this weird symptom on and off, and it freaks me out every time. It only happens when I get out of the shower. My toes will turn noticeably bright red while the rest of my foot remains regular skin color. When this happens they are also very hot when you touch them. There's no pain, numbness or tingling, Just extremely red. Normally it only happens when I get out of the shower, but I got off the couch tonight and it happened. I've done a lot of research on the possibilities and the most common answer is peripheral artery disease and that terrifies me. I suppose I'm just looking for some insight at the moment. I'm a 28 year old male, quite lean. My family has a very good medical history, but my father has hypertension. He's not overweight at all, it's more of a genetic condition than acquired. I've never been diagnosed with hypertension but I wouldn't doubt if I have it or develop it at some point. ",2

"Too Anxious to get a formal diagnosis and medication I've struggled with intense feelings of anxiety for years and years now. I hesitate to say that I have an Anxiety Disorder because I've never been diagnosed, but it affects my life so much that I can't be normal. I can't drive because I get too scared, I'm always terrified when I'm being driven around because I feel like we'll get into an accident or the police will pull us over, and I can't even call my family because phone calls scare me so much. I feel like I'm constantly living in fear, and I know that I want a diagnosis to help me know for a fact that this is what it is, and I really think that medication will help me. But I'm too scared to do it. I overthink about making appointments and if I have to call a doctor to make it, it's an absolute no-go. I don't know how I'm supposed to get help if I can't even take the first steps. I'm currently in therapy, which is amazing that I could even do it, and it's the first therapist that I've ever seen that I feel actually vibes with me, but I'm too scared to ask to try and get diagnosed.

"I have liked this girl now for about 2 years. I have seen all the other boys she is been with. I was friendly with all of them and up until recently I never allowed the guys to affect me personally. But recently in her latest relationship this anger and rage triggered me to feel so much pain and just hate not only her but him. I know I should not and I know its wrong but I feel worthless and empty and useless when someone I like does not like me back and it happens time again. I am not attracted to people who like me (who probably, still do not like me) I do not think of them at all. This girl has been very aware of my feelings the entire time but decided to date every single guy she could find around me (ok not every guy but some of them) and it really upset me because I kept trying to show her effort and attention but she never would let me in or care about me. Maybe a handful of times she was interested in talking with me and it was usually always picking up on bad things I believe because she thinks I am ugly. Of course you do not do that with someone you find attractive. I have felt really suicidal over this and its got to the point know where she knows and we do not talk anymore and act cold around each other. Its been 8 months in their relationship at least and I do not know what I am supposed to do to get over it anymore I am really depressed because this girl does not feel any attraction towards me romantically but not many women also do.",1

I try to describe what it is like to my parents, but it always goes poorly, and I always end up feeling worse. I feel like they always blame me for it, saying that it happened because I am not as active as I used to be, do not eat as well as I used to, and cannot get a good sleep schedule together, and that I can cure it by fixing these and taking the antidepressant that has not worked for the past two months. I used to love working out and lifted every day, and I also used to love making healthy food too. I did not just quit because I got lazy and said fuck it one day. I got so tired that it took the amount of effort I gave maxing out my deadlift to get out of bed in the morning. They also say that I am probably sad all the time because I cannot pay attention in class, but in reality I am so tired and upset a lot of the time that I do not give a fuck about class. It just makes me upset how casually they give me the advice. As if it was super easy, but I am such a lazy and stupid piece of shit that I suddenly forgot that exercise is good for you. Even without their 'help', I have been starting to drag my ass outside for a walk as often as I can, and I have been trying like hell to get into yoga. It just does not feel the way it used to. Whenever I try and express it though, they say that me telling them how I feel and not having a solution for it, and not liking their input makes them upset. Then I just sit there feeling like a selfish piece of shit for spreading the misery instead of just keeping it inside, and thinking that this was the time that they would just listen and sympathize. that is my rant for the day. I feel trapped in my own mind",1

"stress ate and now i feel really poorly. anyone have tips on soothing the aches and nausea? **Just in case anyone needs a TW, there is talk of medication**

**and in advance i'm sorry for any spelling errors**

&amp;#x200B;

wasnt feeling well at all and started stress eating. i tried my stratergies that i do with my psychologist but today was just one of those days if you get what i mean.

i've eaten too much, but a majority of what i've eaten is sugar which also gives me headaches when i eat a lot of it (also in case this is needed information; i dont get sugar high).

idk if i can take nurofen or panadol (Panadol is a paracetamol i think, and i think nurofe contains ibprofen) for the headache because i'm on ritalin (methylphenidate) and Movox (Fluvoxamine, i think its called something else in america though and most people on reddit seem to be from the US) and idk if some pain killers are compatable with ritalin or movox.

im also on a birth control to manage my periods (its called ""Evalyn"", i think im spelling it right, idk the science medication name off the top of my head though) but i know i can take pain killers with my BC. however it does cause mild indigestion. i though it'd be good to include this because the intestines and stomach are connected lol. 

the queasy feeling is really bothering me and i feel sickly. does anyone have any tips on what i can do to ease it? ive drank lots of water (both for the stomach ache/ queasiness and for the headache) and have my big water bottle next to me in case i need more, but it hasnt helped. just looking at anything food related is making me feel like im gonna throw up too. i've thought of sleeping it off but i struggle to nap during the day and i've already slept in a ton this morning so my body doesnt feel sleepy at all, i've tried putting ASMR on too but that isnt making me sleepy.

would really appreciate if anyone knows how to help this. i might try looking more into wether i can safely take some pain killers or not (using reliable sources so that i can make sure i'll be safe)

i'm also gonna ask on a medical related subreddit if i can take ritalin and movox with pain killers at the same time because it's really hard to find information online on my own.

thank you to anyone who reads this and thank you to anyone who can help, means a lot to me",2

"Then, the issue was that she was too dehydrated for a blood draw and the mental health hospital wouldn't take her without the draw. So, I had to take her home and pump her full of water and food and cross our fingers that she could get a draw in the morning. By morning, the bed had filled. So, the counselor and I took her to the Emergency room to see if they could admit her at the local hospital. There, she absolutely *refused* to have her blood drawn and the ER told me that they were just going to have to discharge her if they couldn't get the tests.",0
"Its been so long. So many years wasted laying in my bed avoiding everything. Because I do not belong in this world. If Id actually done something about it when I was younger it might have worked out better. But I got pushed to the back when my siblings needed special care for their needs. I pushed it all to the back of my mind so I would not be a burden if I asked for help. Ill do it later was always the way I looked at it. Deal with the feelings later. But now its a decade later and I still feel like I have not done anything to fix it. I have tried therapy, pills, mindfulness, all of the bullshit they tell you will help. Pills gave me worse feelings, therapy felt belittling and like I was just an issue they wanted out of the office, mindfulness does not work. My own psychiatrist does not even help. He pushes pills endlessly or tells me well stick to Zoloft for now, it seems to be working I am on half the dose I was on before, he even said abilify was not needed anymore. It is not working, doctor. I am tired of pills, therapists, appointments. I want it to stop. I have even started thinking about ECT. Just zap it back to normal. If its unfixable, just tell me already. Just tell me there is no fucking hope and let me leave. Stop giving me these false hopes. Its too hard to cope with. I am so angry with it all. I just want to be fixed. I want to be better. that is all I want. To exist without suffering. Over half my lifetime spent in misery.",1

She told me I could not tell anyone, and that she is been going through a tough time and working on this issue by herself. I was anxious to hear what she said, and then she sent me pictures of her wrist all slit up. I was at lost for words. I truly did not know what to say. I have been on this boat and still did not know how to help her. I told her to speak to me on what is going on, and also speak to her counselor in college. I also recommended her to a tele-psychiatrist who could speak to her and prescribe her affordable medication without insurance, so that know one would know. I offered to pay for it too. (Our family is not too supportive on mental health).Its upsetting and I wish I could help more. She lives in a different state and I just do not know what to do. I love my little cousin and too lose her would be too much on my heart. Did I do the right thing? Medications were not too helpful for me but they got me through, so maybe it was not that helpful? I am still in shock and not sure what else to say to her. Maybe I should have said something else. I just want to help. My cousin sent me a picture of her wrist.",1

"Hello, I would call myself as ""depression survivor"" because I have survived a few nearly successful suicide attempts. After some time I have thought myself how to live with depression but I cannot get rid of the ""option"" in my head to kill myself whenever something happens. That ""option"" is 24/7 in my head and even though I consider myself as happy person now, sometimes I still think about it. My question is how can I force myself to not see it as an option. It currently is the biggest obstacle I have to face and I would like some advice from anyone that has similar experience.DISCLAIMER!I have no intent in killing myself. I have learned to not listen to those thoughts. They still remain in my head and I seek any (not only professional) advice in how to at least reduce those thoughts, ideally to get rid of them.Thank you in advance for any suggestions or advice.

"Having a severe panic attack, might be triggering  As  of today, I've suddenly begun experiencing a sweet taste in my mouth.  I'm a long time sufferer of health anxiety, and intrusive thoughts  compelled me to start self-diagnosing what the issue could be. While my  family has no history of Diabetes, and I eat well, I saw that it could  be an early symptom for type 2 diabetes. Since I've seen that, I've  convinced myself that that's exactly what it is, and that my life is  over. I'll just have to live with a future of crippling health issues  from here on out. I can't get it out of my mind, and the fear of that is  overwhelming me. I'm hyperventilating, and I don't know what I can do  to put my mind at ease. I know it's probably nothing in reality, but  this idea claws at the back of my mind, going ""What's wrong with looking  out for your health? It's better to catch these things early"" and it  compels me to look further into it, which further perpetuates the cycle.  I'm so tired, and scared, and I don't know what to do.

"I am a female 18 and I am in depression for almost 4 years. I feel extremely uncomfortable with my parents. they are everything I could ever wish for, but still i feel very unhappy when I am with them. Does anyone feel like this too?I think to myself that I am happy but I somehow feel insignificant to my family and the world. I cannot sleep at night properly and not be happy about anything. I was once admitted in the hospital because of panic and anxiety attack. Also had extreme stress. My parents then told me to stop studying a lot. I always feel like they make a better family without me.My feelings and their rude words that comes out of their mouth unintentionally makes me even more sadder. My head pains too much and I cannot stop crying. I am worth but not to the extent of others in this world.My family is very sweet and happy. My mother is a temperamental person and is always angry. She blames me for not doing anything as she is scared of my elder sister and blaming her and shouting at her will lead to her reciprocating the same. My sister is adamant and very much like - I am what I am I do what I want to...kind of person. She sleeps all day and night and watches movies on her computer lying on the bed. While I study all day to improve my grades. Studying has become a escape route for me. I also started watching other entertainment like k and bl series as I have never been into movies. My whole family just sits and watches movies as everyone in my house are just attached to the tv. My mother still shouts at me for not doing dishes, improper working or just simply for random stuff. She also came to know I watch kpop (does not know I watch bl lol) and started to nag at me. My father is quiet and just asks me to do tasks.. Repeatedly again and again that I get so bored of it and just leave my work to do it. My mother would still shout at me for doing the task. If I mention it was dad who asked me to do so, she would just scold me anyway. My sister will dump all her chores to me too. My mother is very unfair between us too and my sister.Sometimes they would all be in the same room teasing and shaming me while I just fake laugh everything.This is not everything. The thing that pains the most is when they act like nothing happened when others visit our house or something like that. They say I am the best and my sis is equally great and that we study and live great and just like life is perfect is every sense! My sister also likes to cajole and kiss me like a child though I mentioned countless of times that I hate it. She says I am the beautiful person she has ever seen. My mother also agrees to it as she just listens to everything my sis says.The fake mask I wear in front of everyone is starting to pain. I smile at everyone and make everyone laugh till they cry while I am always crying deep inside my heart.I hate that in a place like home, I cannot be myself. I am yet to call it a home, it is always just a house to me. I just want someone to understand and be with me Ps. Just while I was writing this my mom just shouted at me for making tea just for me and not for them. My family...",1

"Last year I got into music production and i quote it as the happiest year of my life.I was working on music 6 hours a day (at least). I once managed to pull off working for 12 hours.I really loved what I was doing , but this year..its different I do not know how.I am just lost , I can barely work for 2 hours and worst thing is games are back into my life. In 2020 everything that could possibly happen that is good to me has happend. I lost all my weight and got on some serious muscles all by working from home. I had such a mentality for work that year , it was ahead of everything.Back then I loved music so much I managed to not play games at all , I once did not boot up anything for 2 weeks straight. Now , I play games almost everyday (for 2 hours or so) and the worst thing is this fucking game Hearts of Iron 4 got me hooked onto it but it did not made me political. I just remember the days when I was a fat piece of shit and was playing that game in 2016 and I get anxious about all of that coming back right at me.I even uninstalled the game few days ago in hopes of my work hours going up but it did no such thing.What I am trying to say is that I lost the working spirit and I do not know how , I am genuinely not a lazy person.There is a person in my life that is stressing me a lot , I think about it everyday and it does bother me.I do not want to talk about it but I do want to meantion it , I was mad at the same person last year but I was still managing to work very hard.I am not suicidal nor do I think about it , just trapped in an endless loop of anger towards myself.Feel like I am in a minefield , that I have to look at every single step I take.There is something to meantion though , I have quit drinking coffee and any unhealthy drinks (energy drinks , coca cola , pepsi and alike) for 6 months now.Those drinks gave me the ability to stay up at night and make music , which was perfect because every producer encourages that , its just like magic when you work on music while your brain is half dead.But now I cannot make it past 10 , what is interesting is that I can play games untill 1 in the morning but not make music and that is 1 of the many reasons I hate myself.

"Backsliding Anxiety Avalanche 35 F and I need help. Apologies for typos (on mobile) and length, but so, so grateful for those who read this. 

My shoulders, chest,  back and jaw are always cleanched like I'm subconsciously trying to curl up into myself. I cant sleep, small sounds cause my heart to race and I wake up with adrenaline. I'm always exhausted, and because of this, I'm feeling so hopeless. I cry out of fear or frustration  at least once a day now making me feel pathetic and empty. I shake, have numb limbs, depersonalization and chronically check my pulse. I feel like I'm dying all the time and like someone vacuumed all the joy and confidence I once built up out of my soul.

I stopped taking sertraline after 8ish years and it's going terribly. I slowly weaned myself off because of an imminent lack of insurance back in September, and I'm not doing well. Before I went off medication,  I went part time from working a full time management position for over 12 years. At first, I was elated to be home so much. I had dreamed of being part time, accomplishing so many things at home, ( we bought a foreclosed home 9 years ago with TONS  of issues) just being less stressed in general, but because of the part time status, I lost insurance. My partner who works 12 hour days and I were not married yet, and knowing I would lose coverage and wanting to get pregnant soon, I slowly weaned myself off Sertraline as responsibly as possible. This actually went okay, surprisingly, but I'm thinking it was because I still had medication in my system. 

Before I was off meds I was binge drinking about 2-3 times per week, which has been an issue since I was 18, as well as insane amounts of weed smoking- so, additional self medication that was frankly really bad to do on meds. Drinking was ingrained in me as a coping mechanism that caused so, so many problems over the years. Being medicated helped numb the terrible anxiety and withdrawing I would go through with drinking, so it made it possible to continue this cycle for years. I am a very naturally anxious person,  from childhood until now. I am an only child who had an extremely verbally abusive father which I know caused a lot of problems. 

By December of this year I had noticed the familiar feelings of not just hints-of-anxiousness, but the crippling anxiety coming back. I drink a bit in Decemeber, and for at least five days after, would notice terrible, horrible anxiety, withdrawals and sleeplessness. This was so much more severe unmedicated I literally had to stop which had not happened consistently since my teens. Because of it being a coping mechanism, and major ingrained habit, I had some huge issues mourning a ""friend"" and psuedo-tool I had used for years to overcome social anxiety and insecurity. This was obviously never helping, but in the throes of addiction and habit, I couldn't recognize it. 
 
Then caffeine started affecting me in a negative way. Even small amounts would cause heart palpitations and severe unease. It became a gateway for a panic attack. I would usually consume a decent amount of caffeine before work, which made me feel more efficient, confident and social. Just like drinking. Now, I had lost two major things I used to cope with life. I had some peace with knowing I should have quit drinking years ago and letting it go, but now I couldn't even handle caffeine? But wait! There's more! Enter weed smoking, which I had already largely cut back. I went from smoking as soon as I got home from  work to just before bed to sleep. I have always had major sleeping issues and maijuana helped turn my obsessive thoughts off so I could sleep. Now it was causing the same panic caffeine did. I had a violent panic attack in January after smoking and almost thought I needed to call an ambulance. 

I'm sure by now, you can see I have some substance reliance issues. I know this, and I'm not proud. I should in theory be proud I stopped three bad habits/addictions AND antidepressants. Instead, I feel lost. I feel empty. I feel devastatingly hopeless. I feel truly alien, like I cant be a normal functioning human. I'm chronically jittery, exhausted and scared. I feel like although overcoming addiction I have backslid into my lowest low. I have had to leave work because of panic attacks. I dont go out to social events unless absolutely necessary, and spend the whole time in partial terror. I have no joy in anything I used to care about. I feel like I'm driving my mother and husband insane with my repetitive, obsessive anxieties, insecurities and attacks. They are so supportive, but I cant help but feel like they are a little over it. 

The last two months have been awful. By now, I expected some relief from my brain getting used to being off meds, but instead I'm now worried this is just who I am unmedicated. I obsess about the house not being fixed, people judging it,  things imminently breaking, about not being pregnant yet, ( biological clock shit) disapointing family and friends and its leaving me feeling utterly hopeless. I have been in therepy off and on for years, read countless books, every supplement out there, meditation, watched tons of videos and documentaries on anxiety, improved my diet, reached out to others, breathing exercises... you name it. I know most of the tools to help with anxiety. I've tried almost all of them.  I have held off on going back on medication in hopes of becoming pregnant, but that hasn't happened yet and frankly I dont want to start and stop medication again right now. 

I'm afraid of everything. I feel like I'm disconnected and disassociated from myself. Its unrelenting. I dont have ""good"" days, lately. Shit, I'd take mediocre ones! I have tried to push through, get tasks done around the house to feel like I'm accomplishing something, positive affirmations...nothing is working. I'm so tired. I'm so sick of being afraid of basic life tasks, like making appointments, working, social obligations, etc. I'm tired of feeling adrenaline over every sound, waking up anxious, taking hours to fall asleep because I'm anxious and dont sleep. Im so sore because I'm always clenched and tense. I'm always checking my pulse. Im always worried about horrible things happening to myself and family, health related or otherwise. This cyclical unrelenting chronic crippling anxiety is making me insane. I am considering therepy again, but past experiences have not been the best. 

I guess I'm just trying to find someone who gets it. This isn't something I feel like the average person who I've talked to about anxiety understands. Who else has panic attacks in the freezer aisle of the grocery store, work or at baby showers? My senses feel so heightened to any stimuli. I cant keep putting on a brave face and hearing people's surprise when I tell them how anxious I am all the time. ""But you're so calm! You seem so chill!"" Ugh. I must mask it well because I'm internally combusting. This doesnt feel like it will ever relent, and I'm starting to just feel anxious and depressed, chronically. I cant live like this anymore, and I'm losing all hope of improving.

I have a very small family, only my parents and two grandma's with dementia. Long story short, my parentd are very protective of me, so a lot for me and almost always at home a d talking to me.

Think is, I hab eno passions. I never learned to fight for something, instead I give everything up. Because bullying I have a hard time making friends, let alone keeping friendships. All three friends I have rn are living far away. I have no job or career path that sounds like fun to me. I am not made to work the same shit 40 hrs a week. there is nothing I want to do. Besides that, I have no experience in life because my parents do everything for me, I am afraid that if I move out I would call them 5 times a day, either because I need help or because I feel bad for leaving them. My life has nur purpose or sense. I am turning more and more into the person that normal people make fun of. I am joking ill be a weird cat lady when I am older but it is less and less funny. I am pathetic. And if I ask older people for advice all they say is that it will get better once I move put and that I can still find my passion and my I dependency, which helps me not at all. I am not even asking for help here because I feel like I am a person that cannot be helped. I am not made for life. I need to get this off my chest because I cannot tell this anyone in person.

"Stressing about Studying I am in my mid 30s and have just been given the chance to do an extra year and a half of study in a different University. The degree that I have was more theory based and I really need hands on experience to be employable in my field, which I now have the opportunity to do alongside guaranteed internships and portfolio work. 

My stress levels are currently through the roof about this, as I am worried that I won't be able to match the calibre of current high school leavers, who, even though treated as adults at University, still seem to have that high school mentality. My main issue is, even though not permanent, the dorm style accommodation and the fact that an ""old"" person is living with basically a teenager, although I did apply for a single room with a shared bathroom, so maybe not so bad. 

Usually I wouldn't have a problem with this, but already having experienced this with not much success, I am now stressing immensely. I'm not there to be anybody's friend, but the way I have been treated in the past, just for being a little older has been disgusting. There is not much available accommodation at all in the country, so looking for anything else is currently out.

Honestly, I think I'm just stressing because I'm over 30 and feel like I still don't have my life in order, with another future gap in my resume.

But was ghosted because they were upset i had quit in the first place. 7 years later still at this (new)job, its consistent, i make money. I feel secure. And glad i left the place prior.
3years ago i got engaged but wasn’t anxious about anything. Because we halted planning a wedding to buy a house
2 years ago my fiancé and i bought a house. It was fun leading up to the week before closing. The day before i was crying, anxious, scared. I felt like iwas making a mistake. What if we lose the house? What if something happens and we cant afford it because we have a mortgage now. I was fine after a couple days. Im sssoo happy in my home.
8 months ago, i got married. For the 3/4 months leading up to the wedding, i had horrible anxiety. Every single night id have lingering anxiety, some nights better than others, but always there. 
The week before the wedding i was a mess, scared of being married, scared of the change. But i am ssoo in love with my fiancé, he is my everything. I couldn’t understand the anxiety because i was happy! The day of the wedding i was emotion filled, i couldnt talk to anyone while getting ready, i was a nervous wreck. Once we left the church i felt ssooo different! I was actually FEELING how i felt. Happy, excited, in love. Not anxious. The reception was amazing! Im soo happy!

Now-im 29, husband is 30. We are talking about kids. I want them, but im sssooo afraid of the anxiety i know ill have. Im scared of the pregnancy, what if i have a difficult time, what if im anxious like i was for the wedding for all 9months? Im soo scared of giving birth, of the potential postpartum depression, me not connecting. Or what if i dont connect with baby? Idk im already anxious thinking about having an approximate date to get off birth control. Im scared. I brought up adoption but i hate the fact that id rather chose adoption JUST because of the anxiety. I know ill deal with it when the time comes closer to adopt. But it wont be 9months. 
Why does my body do this to me. I hate my anxiety. 
Who else deals with this? How do you overcome?",2

"I finally bit the bullet and saw a therapist virtually today for my crippling depression. I have a lot going on. Chronic illness heading toward complete inability to walk, I feel physically terrible 24/7, unhelpful family, social isolation, child with health issues and disabilities who I will be caring for her entire life, money problems, etc. I just want some coping mechanisms, some way to find moments of happiness sometimes. Some hope. I talked to her for an hour and at the end she said, ""You definitely have depression. I would talk to your doctor about trying a different antidepressant. We can try a couple more therapy appointments but you have got a lot to deal with and I do not know how much I can do for you.""Is it truly hopeless? My life is just terrible and will remain terrible forever? I feel so much worse than before! If a professional looks at my life and sees no hope, what could the person living it possibly do?!

"Lightheaded/ dizzy after walking I (33/m/222lbs) recently started my weight loss journey (down 27lbs since january) and started going to the gym this week. I spent 45 minutes on the treadmill just walking and afterwards felt very dizzy and lightheaded. I make sure to drink lots of water throughout the day. I did lead a very sedentary lifestyle before this, and have recently quit smoking. Does anyone else ever feel this way after walking? Is this normal? Am I just THAT out of shape?",2

"""I am happy..."" ""So happy to..."" ""Wow, sth is so exciting/I am so excited..."" I cannot keep hearing/reading these phrases without sensing a sort of rejection from within. It feels like I have not felt it since so long ago that it is become a completely alien feeling to me.

"Hey everyone so thier is something more to my sadness that I need to tell you guys about, so I have been seeing alot of fucked up shit recently, like some serious fucking awful things, something that you would not consider human. I have been seeing it on YouTube, Mangas, animes, and movies (the type there are so fucked up and graphic that they get banned in alot of different countries).And when I saw what was happening in those things I break down and cry because the person who is being put through that pain does not deserve it I wish I could just jump into the T.V, comics, Manga, anime, movie, and just save that person. I know that is dumb to think and it is not healthy either but back then I was a fucking horrible person and I hate my past self for it every sing day and I wish I could apologize to the people that I hurt. And when I saw those things I break down and cry because nobody at all deserves to be knocked to the ground and be treated like a play thing.But that is not all because not only am I sad I am also scared, the shit I saw was some like deep web live stream were they torture and violate the person they are doing it to and I imagine myself being in that terrifying andni do not want that happenings to me or anyone else because that is sickening.And the fact that it is real makes it even more scary because now I am afraid of going outside at night while having the fear of being kidnapped and I just want these bad things in my head to stop already.

"Hi all, I relate deeply to a lot of the posts I see on this page and I would like to offer some encouragement.There was a long period of time where I was in complete isolation and the pandemic further isolated me. I turned to negative things to cope with the depression and loneliness like mind-numbing television, alcohol, and hanging out with people that were toxic for me due to the fear of being alone.After years of therapy and growth, I wanted to share some words of encouragement for all my lonely hearts out there &lt;3* Being afraid of being alone is totally normal.* The reason you may feel so alone is because you are not sharing with anyone your feelings. You are not being seen/heard in the way you need to be seen/heard. I hope this post helps you connect in some way to know that you are not alone and many others have gone through the same/similar thing.* Growing love and respect for someone else requires time spent with that person. Over time, you may fall in love or grow great respect for people that show you who they are, what they value, how they talk/act, etc. what is the difference between that and growing self-love &amp; self-respect? You must spend that time with yourself to grow that love and respect for yourself. Alone time can be seen as an opportunity if we look at it this way.* To feel less alone, meditating for 5 minutes a day, journaling, and shadow work exercises can help you. A shadow work exercise that really helped me (that I learned through my spiritual journey/therapy) is to look at yourself in a mirror and ask yourself questions - you will be surprised what comes out.* Start some hobbies, anything and everything that you can afford to do. If it ends up flopping, that is okay. You can move onto the next thing and remember, you have time.* Over time, you will hopefully realize that time alone gives you the opportunity to do what you want, recharge, and protect your energy from people.* We are quick to defend others when they are talking negatively about themselves e.g. your friend says ""I am so ugly"" or ""I am so fat"" or ""I am so worthless"" - we immediately tell them they are not and give them a plethora of compliments to negate it. But when we are doing negative self-talk, we just feed into that and feed into that. You must be kind to yourself, you must defend yourself. Tell yourself you are having a bad day and know that it will get better.These are just some things that have helped me along my journey of feeling very lonely. I hope some of these things help you &lt;3TLDR; I have a YouTube video regarding these topics that I go into further. In my video, first I tell you my story, then I go into the pros/benefits of spending time alone, and then I finish with some friendly suggestions on what you can do alone. You can find my video by searching ""kelly guidance how to stop feeling alone spiritual chat.""You are never alone. I am sending you all so much love and light. Remember to always be kind to yourself and others. One day at a time. Friendly suggestions for anyone who feels alone &lt;3",1

"Can anxiety give the sensation of food particles sticking in the throat? Over the past week and a half I've been tortured with anxiety of having a tumor in my esophagus. I've had a feeling of a lump in the left side of  my throat and it feels like little bits of food (chips, breadcrumbs) are sticking in my throat. Initially this fear came from me overthinking symptoms of something else, and now it feels like there's really something in there. I've seen an ENT and he wants to give me antacids for GERD for a week and see if it makes a difference, couldn't be convinced to give me an endoscopy since I'm young (20) and have obvious symptoms of anxiety, I believe.

I spend countless hours thinking about all the stuff I want to say to the people that made me feel this way.

"Physical with Family Friend :/ Hey guys! So, this is pretty awkward, but I don't know where else to turn.

I'm a 23 year old man with severe insecurity about my body. Long story short, I was recently accepted into a Nursing Program at a local college. Part of the admissions process involves a physical exam. 

I enlisted in the Army at 18 and had a physical at MEPS, but the doctor was an old man, so it didn't matter much. This time, however, the physical will be at a local clinic due to my lack of insurance. 

The doctor and the practitioners that work in his practice are all old family friends. (Like, since I was about 6) I'm extremely nervous because I'm afraid the physical will make things weird around these people. 

I know logically that they're all skilled medical care providers and can surely separate personal and professional lives well, but I'm still a little embarrassed. Does anyone have some advice? 😅",2

"Since late 2018 to now, I have been battling with depression. I did not realize I had it until mid 2019 because it came to a point where I was extremely empty, starving myself, and crying almost every night. I would hurt myself and even go to this bridge that was underneath a freeway and contemplate jumping or not. School was an absolute shit show and I felt like I was learning the most pointless things while I was struggling to battle my own mind so my grades started slipping.Admittedly Covid was the only thing that saved me and helped me graduate since I did not have to deal with anyone and did the work on the computer and because the schools would not let the grades drop even if you did not do the work (the grades could only go up.) I started dissociating emotionally since last year. Whenever anything remotely stressful pops up my brain numbs all emotions and I start to feel super disconnected from the world.As of right now, I am twenty years old and I feel like this constantly and it is really hard to connect with other people. I find it extremely weird when someone is crying because my brain has decided to disconnect all emotions when I start to feel sad or stressed out and everything just becomes meh and bland but it is been like this for so long that I do not even know if I will actually feel anything again. I do not even know why I am posting this because I do not feel like I am supposed to be here, but I guess I am just hoping that someone will see this.I literally feel like a ghost. Like I was not meant to be here. I feel like the people around me are not real. I always wonder why I was brought into this world. Everything feels surreal and odd. Whether anyone sees this or not, if you read it, thanks. I guess I just needed to vent my thoughts on the way I feel. Almost complete loss of emotions. I do not feel human.",1

"my brother has not spoken to our mother in over 10 years and he just started speaking(texting) to me again after ghosting me for 3 years. I was listening to music and a song came on that always made me think of our family situation. I did not think he would even listen or reply but he did and he sent me back a song that must have been on his heart with the situation and knowing that is how he feels breaks my heart. Growing up we were abused. When he would be the one on the receiving end of the abuse it always broke me to see my big, strong, charismatic, athletic brother have such a deep sadness but the kind you can only recognize if you have felt the same way. No tears or screaming..just brokenness. I have recovered from my childhood very well considering. However that small interaction with my brother the other day has really brought back a lot of feelings. I adore my brother while on the other hand I have made the decision to forgive our mother and that is something that will always put a strain on our relationship. We went from being so so close to now me having a 2.5y/o he is never even met even though I have invited him many times. He also agreed to come meet her on her birthday and canceled 20min before he was supposed to be here. He told me that the only way he feels like he can be okay is to be independent and prove to himself he does not need anyone. Me on the other hand feels like in order for me to be okay i need to hug my brother and tell him i love him and see him be an uncle to my baby :( so basically I have been crying since monday and thinking about how i do have unresolved anger towards our mom and maybe i need to talk to her about how i feel, but I have felt fine with everything for awhile until finding out how hurt my brother still is a vent post, triggering convo w/ brother",1
"It's something that I continually come back to when I am thinking about my anxiety, and how it manifests. Lately, I have found some consistent stability with zoloft, and therapy. Long story short, after about half a year of being unemployed due to panic attacks at work causing me to be miserable, I am ~5 weeks back into a new job in a different field, on an SSRI, and feeling more or less great. As a result, I've had some more time to focus on what actually triggers my anxiety, rather than fighting off daily bouts of throwing up from panic. Sometimes, it's reading about politics, other times, it's ruminating over a perceived medical issue, or something ""big"" I need to do at work, or in the near future.",0

I only ask people how they are if they seem to not be in a good mood and I would actually care to find out what's wrong. Someone might say ""what if they may not seem sad but still have something wrong with them?"" Then that most likely means that they are hiding it and that they would rather not talk about it (like many of us).

I always say that I am fine just because I don't want to explain to them my issues because they would not understand at all and I know this because I have tried this MANY times.

I believe many people here also feel the same or at least something similar to this.",1

"Blood Tests Hey y’all,
First time poster, so be kind :) 

I have had health anxiety for a long time. I’m currently a 24 year old female with lots of manageable chronic issues. This requires a lot of blood tests.

Every time I have to get one, I get really freaked out to the point of causing fights with loved ones and raising my blood pressure with constant anxiety attacks. I’m afraid I may pass or during blood tests, and passing out is one of my biggest fears. Hearing about how it’s really not harmful and I’ll be fine once I wake up is unhelpful. It’s a trigger for me.

And here’s the thing: I have never passed out, only gotten slightly woozy. Every time it’s better than I imagine it being. 

Can someone give me some advice on how to prevent the slow spiral? ",2
"When I was younger I remember being so happy and curious about the world. I literally asked my parents hundreds of questions because I loved finding out about the world. When I got to my young teens I was still as curious, but I started to realise how fucked up the world was. Id also fucked up by developing autogynephilia, which is arousal to the thought of being a woman. Its all I ever masturbated to. This led me to developing gender dysphoria, but not enough to want to transition. I still have the thought in my mind but Id never go through with it.I have only ever been truly in love with one girl, and since I have finished school for good about a month ago (I am 16) she is now dating my old best friend. Small world, I guess. I am scared of sex and intimacy in general, but I have actually seen them together in public or on social media together and it just makes me so *numb* and jealous because I think that should be me with her and not him. I have never liked someone like her. And of course now I have dysphoria it hurts even more for reason. Just my luck.Back to the dysphoria, its made me have thoughts of suicide for the first time in my life which really scared me. I just want to be like every other boy without getting this voice in my head telling me its not right. I have stopped working out and am avoiding masculine things in general, I even get dysphoria looking at my own dick. Literally 3 MONTHS AGO I LIKED IT. Apparently I am also conventionally attractive for a guy which I promise is not bragging because I do not even feel happy about it. I am so desperate to be able to talk that as a compliment but I just fucking cannot. I just feel betrayed by my own brain. How am I going to live a good life when everyday I wake up hopeless. I have just applied for my first job in a bar but I am so anxious to fill out the forms. I am 3 days late to do it. Mostly from the dysphoria but I just have anxiety in general, as well.I was always told Id be something great, I was called the gifted kid which as a lot of people know is NOT very good thing surprisingly. I feel like I have wasted my life already and I am only 16. what is the point in going forward if its just going to be this??? I feel like I have been cursed. I have always tried to be a good person and do the right things for my future, but now I just feel like none of that matters anymore.what is the point in life if all you can do is watch OTHERS enjoy themselves, but not yourself? I do not want to watch others live the life that I want, which is just people that are comfortable in their own skin. And you want to know why I am like this?? I got horny at a fucking crossdresser when I was 11. How fucking dumb is that. I feel like I am not even going to make it to 20 if it carries on like this. I am actually laughing at myself. How the fuck have I messed up this badly lmaooo. Fuck life. I feel like a wasted life.",1

"Chronic stress with symptoms I have had a few health problems this year. After quite a lot of investigation and tests the doctor is fairly sure it's chronic stress.

I have dizziness, fatigue and quite a lot of muscle aches/very localised chest pains. I've had some therapy which helped me realise at least that I am so stressed and deal with some of the stresses in my life, but now even at a period of low stress my symptoms have continued.

Does anyone else have these symptoms and have any hints on how to manage them?",3

"I have been working from home since the pandemic began and still live with parents.Since then I have hardly left the house or seen friends and feel like both my mental and physical health have been impacted tremendously. I am not very outgoing and do not have a partner so I do not really have any reason other than work or going out with friends to leave the house. But staying in the house all the time makes me feel like I have been missing out on really important life events.I have noticed over the past year it is been getting harder and harder to wake up in the mornings and throughout the day it just feels like a slog. I have become very distant from the work I am doing and do not take it as seriously anymore. It does not really feel like work at this point, just something I happen to do during the day. Everyday's the same and when something goes wrong I feel quite intimidated because I feel like it is invading my private space.I have tried writing and wanted to exploit home working to give me an opportunity to really practice my skills but it is been a disaster and I have not written a single story since the pandemic began. it is my aspiration to be a writer and I feel like I have just flushed it down the toilet. My mood has completely turned me off writing altogether and it just feels pointless at this stage. It sucks too because I get pretty excited about it.In February and March I was having major suicidal thoughts and although they have went away the odd feeling pops back into my head which makes me worry that one of these days I am going to do something to myself. I have tried to make use of mental health resources but I do not really feel like I want to help myself, I check out a website or have a chat with someone and then I drop it again until I have another depressive nosedive. I also contacted a therapist last year but I was not comfortable with phone or video chat therapy due to privacy issues.I badly want to have meaning in life but right now it feels like I live for other people and I am really not enjoying work right now. it is not even the work itself, it is just the thought of doing it. Recently we have been pretty quiet but sitting around doing nothing all day does not help either. there is talk of going back to the office which I think might help if I get back into a routine again but most of my colleagues do not want to go back so I am worried I will be alone, plus it is dependent on if we really need to go into the office (which we really do not as we have shown we can work from home) and Covid cases. there is also certain aspects about office working that I think I will struggle to get used to again, so I feel pretty divided. Covid has completely destroyed my social skills.Sorry if this is a massive rant, I am not exactly sure what to write but I just feel pretty down right now. it is late and I cannot sleep which is when my mind goes on a tangent and attacks itself. I just want to feel like I have some sort of meaning in life and something to hold onto and develop. I was hoping that thing would be my writing but I do not feel like touching it right now because of how unmotivated I feel. I feel like the last year has been an absolutely waste of time and I just feel very replaceable and blank at this point. Feel like life is on hold due to working from home",1
"DVT Anxiety Hi all, 

&amp;#x200B;

So starting Monday morning my right leg (thigh just above the ankle) started to hurt in a weird mix of a cramp and DOMS like way. The pain didn't go away for three days now and yesterday when examining it with my gf my leg has also swollen and became tender at the area where the pain comes from.

&amp;#x200B;

This morning I went to my GP who measured my legs, and examined them with her hands. She said she doesn't think it is a vein issue just a pulled or twisted muscle, so I should just rest and take over the counter muscle relaxing meds. I told her that I did not do anything particularly active over the weekend (just sleeping and playing video games pretty much), she still said that I could have just strained a muscle while sleeping and it might keep on hurting for 1-2 weeks even. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am still very worried and anxious as DVT is often misdiagnosed and people even die after being sent home thinking that it is just a muscle strain. My leg still hurts with no improvement whatsoever (maybe even getting a bit worse, although that might just be my brain), it is swollen in one area, but I am not feeling extra warmth and there is no discoloration.

Are your families comfortable with listening to you? I hate that I cannot talk about it",1

Every once in a while Ill just admit that I really do not feel like interacting but they will either push me to do so until I accept or just worry about me.

"Diabetics Ketoacidosis and Brain Cancer Hi I'm new here. I started having very mild health anxiety when I was younger but it recently increased the last few months. In December, I went to the ER due to chest pains because I was sure I was having a heart attack even though I was terrified. I went to the doctor and they said it was just acid reflux and they sent me home with a prescription. After that, I had to follow-up with my PCP and she told me there was an abnormality in my EKG (my second one) and referred me to a cardiologist to do an echocardiogram. That same week, I was worrying about every little ache and symptom that I've read about heart attacks and kept manifesting each one. It sucked because I didn't feel like it was all in my head and I kept freaking out. Mind you, I'm a college student away from home which made everything worse. Winter break came and I went home. I didn't feel any symptoms and I wasn't worried about my health anymore. Then I came back to school last month and my friend had a stroke. She's 19 so I was surprised at how young she was to be having a stroke. This event stirred up my past anxieties about my heart and I found myself checking my heart rate often throughout my day again. I would also google every possible heart condition that I could have that I wouldn't know of. The next week, I finally got my echocardiogram done and the doctor said it was completely normal which eased my mind at little bit. That same week, I had on and off nausea which I was sure was because of how anxious I was about my health. The next few days go by and I start having tension headaches (or so I think). They were on and off as well but it just hurt to the point where I was convinced I had brain cancer. With the nausea and the headaches, I just assumed. I tried to refrain from googling the symptoms because I knew it would elevate my worries but I couldn't resist. The last few days, I've been so worried about having brain cancer because I wouldn't be able to focus and some things were hard to remember, but there is no family history of any type of cancer so I kept trying to focus on that. Now, I am currently worrying that I have Diabetic Ketoacidosis. I have no family history of diabetes and I've never been told that I should watch out for it because I am 18, normal weight, and have been healthy. But lately, I've been stress eating because of how anxious I've been and food makes me feel a little better. However, I always feel guilty right after eating and it makes me feel sick to my stomach. I just don't know how to cope with this anymore and I have a doctor's appointment next week so hopefully she can ease my mind a bit more. ",2

"I've been worrying about aneurysms since last night and its been a really rough time. How do I get past this? Hey everyone, I'm so glad that subreddit exists because it's so comforting to know that I'm not the only one who struggles with this type of anxiety (since I was a little girl).

Recently though, I have been really sick - like since before Thanksgiving. I've had bronchitis, the Norovirus (ended up in hospital), tonsillitis, the flu, then the stomach flu again, and now I'm at home sick for a week because the cold I've had since early November never went away and it has turned into walking pneumonia and strep throat. My throat is covered in huge white blisters and it's just so disgusting.

But anyways, I was put on a really high antibiotic and Prednisone 3x a day, and it's just made me feel anxious and so strange. I started feeling like my pulse in my groin and it really freaked me out, so I Googled (I want to punch myself lol) and the first thing that came up was aneurysm. Then my husband told me it was probably the steroid making my nerves jittery, so I googled again (I rly need to stop) and it said that some people have experienced something called ""phantom vibrations"" or something like that. The thing is though, I'm pretty sure this has happened to me before and I've never paid it any attention.

I had a rly bad panic attack right after that, but I took a shower and calmed down and was fine. But today, my hip and leg have been aching, and I'm not sure if it's my fibromyalgia acting up bc I'm sick or if it's just a psychosomatic symptom or even possibly the Prednisone  making me feel this way.

Has anyone else ever experienced this? Because I know it's probably nothing, but I've just had a rough time today with being worried about it And having the thought of aneurysm in the back of my brain.

Bless you if you made it to the end of this post.",2

I have lost the motivation to take care of myself. I have put on weight.

"worried i have something seriously wrong to start off i’m pretty sure i’m suffering from depersonalization/derealization. after i smoked weed (even though i had smoked many times before) about a month ago i just had that unreal feeling. apparently this is very common. smoking weed, having a panic attack, and then BAM depersonalized. 
i have anxiety and depression, so even though what this is is most likely just depersonalization i cant help but think it’s something worse. like a brain tumor or something.
i am nearsighted so i do have blurred vision (bit with things close up like looking at my hands or something close to me) but recently i’ve noticed sort of vertical doubled vision? if i look at something i can see a little bit of a ghost image above it it’s sort of hard to explain. it’s only for far away objects and it’s worse when looking at letters like on a tv or poster. i read somewhere that this could be just from being nearsighted and it isn’t double vision. i also read on a forum where somebody thought they had a brain tumor to do the “pinhole test” where you make a small circle with your fingers and put it close to your eye and if the double vision goes away it’s an ocular problem and not neurological, which made me feel better.
i’ve had no headaches but bad memory and trouble focusing as well as the not feeling real feeling.

I have (32) been on anti-depressants and anxiety meds for 2 1/2 years now and seeing a therapist twice a month.

I want to talk to my family about it but do not want this to weigh on them or become a burden/worry about me. My wife and BiL (also bipolar) are the only ones who know. How do you tell someone that you do not feel emotions? You do not experience joy or pain. you are just numb. To everything and everyone. You do not want to kill yourself but you do not want to exist. That life has become a cycle of just getting through days. That simple things like getting out of bed are sometimes the hardest fucking thing ever.

The neuropsychologist I saw offered me books to read to learn more about my condition but did not give any other treatment options because the cause of my disorder was unknown. I was wondering if maybe now that I know why I most likely struggle with memory, I can go back to get more solid treatment options? If so, who should I see for help?",3

"Like you, I have suffered greatly during my 28 years of existence. I am posting this because I have finally unsubscribe to this subreddit. I am sure I am going to get conflicting opinions about this, but I think that this is an important thing to talk about.Since I have finally lifted myself out of depression, after many years pain and suffering, I find that seeing these posts in my feed make me feel sad. I do not want to feel sad anymore, not that anybody does, but I see that if I unsubscribe I will not have this daily dose of sadness in my life anymore.This is important to note because I think that this happens to more people than we tend to realize. Once somebody finally gets out of depression it would behoove them to distance themselves from negativity and sadness regardless of the pain and suffering of those enduring it.My point is this, one of the problems with depression and why it seems to be largely ignored or exploited for monetary gain, might just be that once people get out of it they stop engaging with the community because it makes them sad. It does not mean I am not going to continue to help people whenever I can because I will and I do. it is just something I have noticed that I think people might want to hear about.I wish you all the best of luck, my breakthrough was getting back together with one of my childhood friends who was around when I went through most of the childhood trauma that I endured. Being with him brought me right back to when I was being molested in my basement by a mutual friend of ours. It felt like I got struck by lightning. Hanging out with my friend and engaging in playing a video game that my molester used to play with us all the time seemed to somehow get my emotions to start functioning properly again. It felt like whoever I was, died in that basement at 13 years old. Like all of my emotions became stuck in time and unaccessible. My emotions are finally working again, and I do not think there would have been any chance of me recovering without them back. I am not quite sure how this works, but I am actively trying to duplicate my experience in those around me who are suffering. If anyone else has experienced anything like this I would greatly appreciate it if you would share your experience.I wish you all the best of luck. And I know how much it hurts. I never thought it was going to get better I was convinced I would end up offing myself before 30. I would encourage you to go and find the people that you were hanging around when you were young when the worst things in your childhood happened to you.

"Like a part of me died over a year ago. During the pandemic. It made me reflect everything about myself. I do not enjoy video games anymore because I feel like I wasted my life on them. I tried to get into DnD, like I did when I was 17 again, but I cannot comprehend it anymore. I cannot understand it. It upsets me that I cannot get into what I enjoyed. I lost many great relationships because of loosing interest in things very quickly. I have started to sell my video game collections. I am making good money but inside I do not feel happy. I have accomplished a lot in my life. Yet I am unemployed, single and unhappy with my life. Where have I gone wrong? I have reflected on that to much but I cannot figure it out. I am reaching a point where I just do not feel I am worth the time or patience. I do not want to burden anybody. Even if I ask for help I do not accept the advice that is given to me because I do not feel like I deserve it. it is not like I grew up in a broken home. Sure my parents are divorced and I know for a fact it was not my siblings and I. I have always felt like I do not deserve the time of day with anybody ever since I was a child. What the fuck is wrong with me? I am getting closer and closer to 40. I should have my life figured out by now. Yet, I do not. Ugh. I feel like I am loosing something",1

"Yes I am jealous of good looking people. Yes I know it is vein. I hate everything about my body and how I look. I am always going to be the ugly duckling, or at best, a 'slightly below average Joe'. I get looks of people feeling sorry/embarrassed/ disgusted at me. But hey at least I am ""a genuinely nice guy"". I have absolutely zero confidence. I always feel inferior to better looking people, even if they fall behind me in other areas. I feel like I am not even worthy to be in their presence. People who say beauty is only skin deep are just kidding themselves. Good looking people get so much more in life. A lot of little things throughout their lives that add up. They just have that natural confidence, which is hard to fake. This just makes them even more attractive. Who wants to be with an anxious and insecure guy? This manifest into all areas of life, not just dating/sex, but also at work and other areas. Thank God I can now wear a face mask and it is no longer weird. For once, I would love to hear someone comment that I am hot/handsome/sexy. No one turns around to check me out. And I do not blame them, I would not either. My friend is really good looking and a personality that just attracts people (we are gay, not a couple). He always got guys wanting to go out with him, wanting to do things for him, flirting with him etc. No one flirts or smiles at me. In fact, I know they are thinking why does my friend even hang out with an unfortunate like myself (we have been friends since school). I always wonder what it is like being a porn star and being hot and confident with your body, and wanting to show it off to other people. I envy them. I really do. I am cursed to live out the rest of this retched existence being one of the millions of 'uglies' (no offence to ugly people), and I cannot stand it. I could win lotto tomorrow, and I still would not be happy. Yay, I am a millionaire, but I am ugly. Being ugly or unattractive is the worst curse to have in this life",1
I don’t recognize myself I just need to rant real quick. Everything sucks. I’ve been stuck in dpdr for about 2 years now. It’s been bad but it’s gotten worse. My home life hasn’t been great for a while now. My parents have been fighting a lot and recently told me they were going to divorce soon. My sister constantly degrades everyone in the house and will sit around all day and refuse to go to school. My mom is having work trouble. And my dad has kinda been the punching bag of it all. Fighting and yelling has become a regular occurrence. I cant stand it. I’ve been trying to keep myself together and come off as calm so maybe some stress could be taken off of everyone but I’m actually falling apart inside. My theory is if they see that I’m calm they will have one less thing to worry about. I’m always anticipating the next fight between any of the three and it sucks. I actually feel a sense of relief at school because atleast I’m away from all this. But schools not any better. I’ve gotten to the point where I don’t recognize myself in the mirror. I don’t see me I see a shell. I want to get out and run away from everything. Im only 15 so that’s not an option though. Nothing feels real and I just don’t want to be here anymore. I just feel stuck and I have no one to talk to. Every time I would try to talk to my mom about my dpdr she would say I’ve been looking at the internet too much. I don’t want to talk to her about it because im scared she’ll say that again or explode from all the stress. She also dumps all her work problems on me and that just adds to the stress. I’m just scared. I don’t want them to divorce. I just want things to go back to the way they were. I don’t know how much longer I can hold it in. I was diagnosed with depression a couple years ago and have meds but I’m so tired and drained that I can’t remember to take them. I just don’t know what to do anymore.,1

"What is the point?Does any of this matter?Would they miss me if I was gone?And more of the same old questions I have been asking myself since I was 11 years old. They said it was a phase... I am 40 now.The more I look for reasons to keep going, the more reasons I find to leave it.Life does not seem too important. I do not value it like I once did.It seems like we are so disposable. Maybe it was Covid. Seeing all those people die every day and life kept going on. We all noticed the lost. Most of us felt it. But time did not care. It just kept on moving.Even as more people die from the new variants, those of us who are vaccinated make summer vacation plans and try not to think about all the death and tears.I just do not understand it anymore. What is life? Why do we even cherish this world that keeps hurting us so much?Is it only hurting a few of us?Do other people really never think of things like this?Why cannot I just be a drone? Why do I have to have to want more out of life? Why cannot I just be happy that I am alive like everyone else seems to be?I am not expecting any answers to any of these questions.

Some of the teachers probably hate me because of the way I behave. At least in school I have some close friends.I have attempted suicide multiple times and all of them fails.

They were very shocked by this and asked me why. I just told them that I cannot be bothered anymore and I burst into tears. I cannot remember the last time I cried that much, it was a bit of a relief to let it out.But yeah, needless to say they are really worried about me and they want to try to push psychological therapy to come sooner. They also suggested about putting me on a ward to held keep me safe.I just want to curl up in a ball in a corner and be forgotten about.

More often than ever I feel like the problem might be anxiety. I'm not sure how to deal with it or what preventative measures I can take. I'd much rather read or listen to people who have been going through the same scenario as me than to approach a health councilor. 

Any sort of feedback on the things that I can do or maybe even some controversial practices I can try would be of great help.. hopefully


Thanks guys and gals! 


P.S. I feel like my anxiety is not on the level where I would need to start taking medicines for it. I would say that it is on a small level.

Does anyone else here suffer from immense fear of skin cancer? It's a terrible feeling. I've been suffering for about a year now. I've been to my derm about 5 times and my GP 3 times. I'm freaking out about a freckle near the top of my butt bc it looks a little red around it sometimes. I know they don't want to see me again. I just want to be able to go on with my life. I know it's good to be checking my skin but I check mine over 10 times a day. This is the 7th freckle/mole I've been fixated on. I just want to stop worrying like I do.,2

"I felt horrible for her. Ever since, I’ve been close friends with Corrine. She told me a lot about what happened with her family, and we had a lot of late night conversations where she told me about how she had these nightmares of what might’ve happened, how she had bits of her brother’s brain on her shoes afterwards, how she tracked blood through the house while she went to get the phone to call 911.

Every day is so grey and monotonous no matter what I do. Is there any way I can bring some sort of spark back into my life? The issue is not really doing things because I try that, it is more just trying to feel passions again. How to start living again?",1

"Overwhelmed and Exhausted I’ve been struggling recently with stress and anxiety about life in general. I’m having constant headaches and migraines, I’m not sleeping well, I’m overeating…

I’m 21 years old and I’m already feeling burnt out and ready to give up. I work a full time job and go to school part time. I just moved out of my parents house 2 months ago and got an apartment with my boyfriend. I get stuck doing majority of the housework like laundry, dishes, cleaning, and grocery shopping. My dad works all day long and my mom doesn’t drive so Im constantly driving my mom and my younger siblings every where. 

I work 6:30am-3pm and I usually don’t even get to sit and relax until 7pm, then Im going to bed by 8pm but i’m not falling asleep until midnight and Im up on and off all throughout the night. 

Im barely making enough money to pay my bills, and Im also the family bank to my mom and dad. Don’t get me wrong I don’t mind helping them out but they’re constantly asking to borrow money and 9 times out of 10 I don’t get it back.

"Afraid of hospital infection Well, I do not want to rationalize my fear of hospital infection; however, if we look at the stats, hospital infection rates are significantly higher than before. I will have an arthroscopic knee debridement surgery, the procedure just needs two 4-8 mm incisions basically. Usually, patient would be discharged after a few hours of waking up or stay one night at hospital in some cases. I know in every surgery there is a chance of infection and I know that my surgery is one of the easiest surgeries available too. However, I am really afraid to get an hospital infection. I had 4 surgeries before, but the nearest one was 7 years ago when I was 17 years old. I am almost 5 inches taller(6""4') and 100 pounds heavier now(300lbs currently). I mean when we put all those things together, these make me anxious. To sum up:
I am really scared of hospital infection even though my surgery is pretty easy and incisions will be just 8 mm max.
I am slightly afraid of anesthesia since my body changed a lot in last 7 years.

"To medicate or not to medicate? Hello friends. This is my first post here. I’ve been admiring the confidence that you all have in sharing your concerns and stories. Thank you for your honesty. I have enjoyed learning from each interesting thing that you all have to say. 

I have been dealing with severe health anxiety for a little over 1 year now. The destruction it has done is devastating. 

I am entering into a new chapter in my life with many new important roles. Going back to school for my bachelors is one of them. I will need to be face-to-face with many of my specific fears and phobias. 

I’ve been considering starting medication for anxiety, such as Buspar. This scares me. My health anxiety is thinking of all of the possible side effects. 

I am tempted to do this because I want relief. Counseling has only helped mildly. 
CBT has only helped mildly. 
I want to be normal again. 

Thoughts?

For some time now I observed 'symptoms' that my mother is showing which make me really afraid that she might have cancer.

Ever since my own Doc informed me about the risks of ovarian cancer I can't get it out of my head.

I made her see the doctor but she just went for a normal checkup instead of asking for an ultrasound. They did take a blood sample but that is hardly enough to rule this out right?

I really want to let this go because right now it will be impossible to make her go again and I got enough else to worry about. On the other hand if I am right and stop pushing her it will be my fault it wasn't found early enough...

"Hey guys.First of all I wan't you to know that if reading about people recovering is something that puts pressure on you or triggers you in any way better stop reading. I know that back when I was severely depressed I did not want to hear from people that got healthy again because it made me feel like a failure because I could not seem to get there. it is totally fine if you ignore my post. I am just looking for advice from people that have overcome depression to hopefully find out that I am not alone with this. I got diagnosed with severe depression back in January 2018 after already suffering for 3 months without knowing what was up. I got on meds and into therapy, went through many ups and downs and finally went back to university in June 2019. Then in January 2020 I finally felt like I was completely my old self again, stopped taking my meds and going to therapy.The pandemic hit and of course it was hard for me to be back at home with myself after I was finally back out living life after almost two years. But I still think I managed it quite well. Down days were only normal down days (once you have had depression you really get the difference between being down like a normal person and being down like a depressed one) and they passed usually within half a week or so. But now to the reason of my post: they do not seem to pass lately. it is been over a month of me not feeling good. In the sense of: I get ""sick"" a lot (not sure if you know what I mean...it is actually being physically sick but knowing that it is rooted in you not wanting to get out of bed - if that makes sense?) I do not feel like meeting my friends and often cancel, saying I have to study - even tough I do not really plan on studying anyway. I do not seem to see the fun in things I normally like and if I do it fades quickly. I also do not sleep well - it is been a long time since I slept through a night. And of course the classic: I often feel useless and sad, even though I know that I have many people in my life that love me. So I know many of these things can be symptoms of depression. I also know that many of these feelings are also common in people who are not depressed. My problem is that I know how I was when I was depressed and it is not that bad now. So I do not think I am depressed again but it still worries me. I am just scared that it will come back - actually really scared. Because (I do not think I have to tell any of you) it is hell to be depressed. Has anyone else experienced this? I know statistically it is not likely that I will have another episode. Or does anyone have any advice for me? I am sorry if my post is confusing, I just wanted to vent somewhere because it is really hard to explain any of this to people that have never been depressed and also I do not want my family and friends to worry as long as it is not that bad... I am afraid of becoming depressed again",1

"Relentless Nightmare since December! Hello all,

I am 22M and been struggling since December when I had a marijuana induced panic attack. First time smoking and I only did it to make my sister feel more comfortable with smoking since it’s something she enjoys. Like an idiot, I took an absolutely heroic bong rip and had a full mental breakdown for the next 2 hours before I finally woke up and felt mostly normal. I felt okay the next day and then after a week I was very stressed at work and out of nowhere got extremely dizzy to the point I was scared for my life. I drove to the ER and they said it was just anxiety so I drove back home and tried to sleep it off. Didn’t sleep at all for 3 days and was terrified the whole time. Since then I’ve had constant derealization, panic attacks, intrusive thoughts, depression, anxiety, and horrible physical symptoms like dizziness, random headaches that come and go all over my head, body pains, stomach pain, etc..

Since then I’ve had 2 rounds of blood work, CT scan, MRI, seen an ENT, and a neurologist. I’ve also been given all of the following medications and more: prednisone, meclizine, clonidine, zyrtec, flonase, antibiotic ear drops. None have worked. All my tests have shown nothing physically wrong so I’d say it’s fair to diagnose as anxiety-related… though my therapist (I’m new to therapy since this all began) says he’s never had a client with such severe dizziness and brain fog. I’ve been on Zoloft for 6 weeks now and I’d say it is finally helping somewhat. I have changed doses twice from 25 to 50 and 50 to 75 in that time so I’m still adjusting. I was also taking quetiapine 25mg as a sleep aid for a few weeks but I can sleep without it now so I stopped because I wasn’t thrilled about taking an antipsychotic for off-label use to begin with.

Overall I would say I am at about 25-30%. When I started the Zoloft I felt around 0-5% honestly. I was convinced I was going insane and would need to be in an institution during those first 2 weeks.

I have been housebound and on medical leave this whole time so what I’m trying to do to get back to my feet is exercise daily, get outside, drive to my apartment (1hr), and work remote a few hours a day. I am soldiering through these tasks and honestly I do feel better when I’m busy. For example when I play the PlayStation I can push the symptoms to the back of my mind. But the rest of the time it feels like my conscious mind only has 25% awareness while the rest of my mind is lost somewhere else and doing it’s own thing. It also feels like my short term memory and vision are impaired but they’re not. It’s like being stuck in a dreaming state and it’s so scary and frustrating. It’s very hard to describe but I don’t have any delusions or hallucinations so I don’t believe I am suffering from a psychotic illness. 

I have suffered through so much in my life without it physically impeding me or making me question my sanity but these last 3 months have really tested me. Over the last 4 years I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression but I was able to power through 2 degrees, a long distance relationship, a breakup, and building a career I would hardly have dreamed of years ago. I know I am strong and have what it takes to get through this, but the battle is certainly long and difficult. It is unlike anything I’d have ever fathomed a human could experience. It is so overwhelming that it’s easy to think it may never end. I think it will be okay over time, because I believe in the power of the human mind and body to adjust to challenges, but I wanted to share my experience and see what others may think. I will be so grateful when I am healed and healthy because this experience has given me so many insights on what it takes to have a happy and meaningful life. I’ve learned lessons in gratitude, kindness, and compassion that I want to share with others.

P.S.
I really look forward to getting back to the things I enjoy once I’m better: bodybuilding, soccer, vinyls, and working!",2

I spend as much time as I can alone just because going out with friends and seeing them happy just makes me mad that I cannot be like that no matter what I try.

My testosterone is pretty low for a guy my age but not low enough to where I could go on any therapy for it.I just sort of wanted to ask any guys (or girls) if they have the same issues?

"TW. suicide, death Unintentionally. Backstory, I have been on SSRIs for almost 2 years and never skipped a dose. Yesterday however was the first time. I was feeling relatively normal that morning, but as I went out with friends in the afternoon, I remember feeling... a bit glum. I totally forgot I have not taken my meds, so I thought it was just one of those off days. All I can think of that time when I was with them, however, was I felt out of place. My friends were not even talking to me that I felt even more miserable. Granted that anyone would feel the same, I chalked it up to me being timid and not engaging in the conversation. But on that afternoon, I just felt like I was intruding on a somewhat closed space that I was not allowed in. My laughter felt forced and I was not enjoying myself. I almost wanted to cry that my best friend was a little awkward around me that I knew something was wrong and it was because me. I felt like I was a defective pos and that I deserve what I am feeling because I am sick and I am never getting better. I cried that night and thought of committing suicide again. I had tons of suicidal thoughts when my dog got sick and died (I cannot handle grief very much) and it has been 3 months since then. Last night was so downright depressing, I felt like someone died in my family again. I live alone and I cannot trust myself to make decisions when I am horribly depressed, so I decided to go to sleep to maybe cleanse the feelings away. This morning, my family called and asked me what I was doing. They asked if I took my meds. I counted the ones that were left, and knew right then: yesterday, I did not. I got scolded for a while, but it was okay. I took my meds then and placebo or not, I feel a lot better. But still, I kind of realize that I might forever be on SSRIs. A day of not being on it just does things to my brain that I cannot explain. TLDR. Skipped my meds accidentally, got too depressed I wanted to commit suicide. Reminded to take them the next day, felt better (placebo or not, who knows). do not skip your meds, kids. I skipped a dose of antidepressants and it was horrible.",1

I do not mean to self diagnose, but I do not really feel comfortable opening up emotionally about this to people I know, so I came here. I am unsure",1

"As someone who has struggled with depression for most of my life, I know its hard. I have been on both ends. I have been severely depressed and have also had people close to me be depressed. Because I know how isolating and difficult it is, I never hesitate to be there for someone. I am always willing to listen and to provide whatever kind of support they need. I do not care how late it is I do not care how depressed I am or how hard it might be to hear someone I care about talk about how horrible they feel. I am willing to do all of that, because I care. And I know what its like so I do not want anyone I care about to feel like they have to go through it alone. When it comes to me though, people cannot seem to do the same. I have been told its too hard for THEM to be there for me. And I understand. Its draining to be around someone who is always upset and its frustrating when you cannot fix it. I know because I feel all those things about myself too. But if you love and care for someone why would not you be willing to take on that pain with them? Other people I have talked to have told me they have had similar experiences with people either feeling too uncomfortable with watching them cry or too uncomfortable because they do not know what to say. i do not want anyone i care about to feel so drained by me. So I have learned to handle it mostly on my own. Its just hard. And I am tired. People say they will be there but then cannot actually be there. Not because they do not care but because its too hard for them to hear me out. One of the main reasons my ex and I broke up was because he could not handle being there for me emotionally. He was there a lot at the beginning but I think he got tired of hearing the same things over and over again (believe me I am tired of feeling the same things over and over again). He told me that he just does not like seeing me upset because it hurts him. Why is it that the conversation about someone being depressed turns to how hard it is for the people around them ? I am not saying it is not important but what about the person experiencing the depression ?? is not it harder for them ??? Because on top of how I already feel , I also always feel guilty and like a Burden on those around me. Even when it comes to suicide, people tell you that its selfish and your causing them pain...but if I am not strong enough to carry that burden and pain alone then what do i do? I am selfish if I burden you with my problems but I am selfish if I leave . Why is it so hard for people to sit with you in your pain? And why do not do they do it even if it is hard ?",1

"Overwhelmed, tried, struggling I was diagnosed with an other-specified anxiety disorder for about a year now and that sent me into a tailspin during my diagnosis. I was doing therapy consistently since then and felt like I had a handle on things but was triggered into another episode a month ago.

I've had on and off anxiety the whole month, it's affected my relationship, I'm exhausted all the time, struggling also with stomach issues and feel like I'm barely keeping my head above water. My partner has tried to be supportive but I can tell it wears him down. I can't see how I can keep doing this and feeling like this forever.

"I have been trying for so long. Told my family about my depression and they act like they care then forget the next day. I finally managed to ask for professional help from a doctor and my school. I am 15, my parents are divorced. I live with my mum and my dad lives some 2,000 kilometres away. I moved 2 times in the past year and due to that I lost my friends so I do not have anyone to rely on, and I am a year 9 so I friend groups and so on have been already made and I cannot really befriend anyone at this point. I have been struggling the past 3 weeks with anxiety and depression and not wanting to wake up in the morning for school. And to add to injury my mum is now saying I am going to go back to my dads and will have to start working and drop my education, which I do not want to do, and I do not want to make issues for my dad either as he is a driver so he drives 800km per day so he is rarely at home and barely gets sleep. I just do not know what to do at this point, talking about will not help since they will just act like nothing happened, and my dad cannot support me as he is over 2k km away, and he is not the best dad either but still cares enough to see that I am hurting and need help but cannot do much.(I do not know why I am writing this and in such a weird way, I left out so many details but I do not want to make it too long.)TL;DR: I am depressed, seeked help, person who cares cannot do much, broken inside and want to end it all.

Last night he told me that yes you have struggles and you should just own it. Own your self harm scars. FUCKING hypocrite. You never gave a fuck, did you? All of those things you said were bullshit to make you look like a good parent. Guess what? You fucking signed up for this. You signed up for a mentally ill kid.

"I have struggled with depression for a while but it was not until 3 years ago that I decided to start seeing a therapist about it. Before I went to therapy I really did not know what depression was but could definitely tell something was not right, I was pushing away my friends, was not exactly suicidal but I put myself in a lot of dangerous situations and really did not care about the outcome. Depression for me really comes in waves, I have good months and bad months and therapy has really helped me recognize when a bad month is coming on but this self awareness has almost made me feel worst in a way. I am starting to isolate myself again and I just constantly feel like I am letting my friends down because I am aware I am doing it. I just do not have the motivation to talk to respond to them or hangout with them. It just makes me feel so shitty that I realize what I am doing and I am doing anything to stop it. I realized the other day that I had not once checked up on a friend who was going through a breakup. I had not even asked her if she was doing okay. I just wish I could get better. Bad days have been stacking recently.",1
"Having a horrible HA week. This week my HA has just went flying back off the rails. It started with the usual heart palpitations, thinking im on the verge of cardiac arrest. Then i had a day of thinking i was gonna die of sepsis, for literally no reason at all. Like i didnt even have an injury. I keep washing my hands too much. Cleaning the absolute shit out of my house. And as of yesterday my head has settled back on the good ole fear of getting Rhabdomyolysis from powerlifting. Because i think i overdid training yesterday. I had a back injury that kept me from doing specifically squats for like almost a year. So i have been afraid to do them. Deadlift and bench are fine and i go heavy. But i have really only been doing squats on the high volume speed work day. I was doing pause squats with only 1 plate (per side) on the bar. Its way too light and i have been afraid to go heavier. So yesterday i decided to do box squats 10 sets of 2 with 30 sec rest. With 1 plate and one chain (per side). For resistance. It felt easy and i completed it and went on to do the rest of the exercises per usual. But then it sudden hit me that i did more weight with high volume than im used to on that particular exercise.  I do more than double that weight on deadlift, but still, thats not the same. And ill probably get rhabdo. Later on in the evening i felt nauseous and i think i have some pain in my quads. No other symptoms. But i read you could have it and have NO SYMPTOMS WTF. Idk if the nausea and migraine i got was from the major anxiety from the rest of the week leading up to this or from rhabdo. Im really trying to not do the whole panic and go to the ER thing that i always do when i get like this. Im ruining my sleep schedule that i worked really hard to fix (i have insomnia from ptsd), and i didnt want to sleep until i knew i didnt have it. Im still panicking over it today. And as soon as i get anxiety the nausea comes back and i think about the minor soreness in my quads and how its going to kill me or make me very sick for a long time and ruin everything. Its fucking awful. ",2

"I think most of my negative traits and quirks come from the fact that I have absolutely no confidence in myself what so ever. I sabotage myself at every chance, I refuse to stand up for myself even for the tiny things. I refuse to participate most of the time and when I do, I do not put in much effort. I withdraw from everyone around because I do not think anyone wants me around. I let people verbally abuse and mock me with no resistance. I just bottle up the pain and the anger. I used to think I would explode one day, but even when I get angry I hold back. I do not have the confidence in myself to let loose righteous anger or even defend myself when someone is being abusive. I have piss poor social skills though I am exceptional at faking it.I feel this desperate need to take a stand or finally stand up, but despite having so many chances to grow the backbone or simply just tell someone to fuck off, I have yet to do so. I wish I had a mentor when I was a kid to help guide me and help me find value in myself. Instead I was mostly left to fend for myself, but instead of being hardened I was softened. I have negative self confidence",1
"Unsubscribing today. Thanks for all of your support. This sub has helped me through a lot of health concerns, but today I'm finally in a place where I can deal with it on my own so I'm posting to hopefully help someone else.

I started off as a mess and eventually got a full heart/body checkup including an MRI and wore a heart monitor for 24-hours to check out my palpitations. After being told that everything is fine that was a big step. Getting a professional, comprehensive medical diagnosis to rule out what you're worried about goes a long way. After chest pains, numbness, tingling in my limbs, dizzy spells, being sent to the ER because urgent care thinks I might be having a stroke, and a ton of other shit, something outside my control changed: my stress level. I took on a different role at work that is much less stressful. I had no idea how big of an impact this was because I didn't consider myself ""stressed"" but several symptoms subsided with this change like everything digestive and the chest pain is less frequent. After I was told the chest pains are costochondritis (inflammation of the rib tissues, read: stress-induced) I saw a chiropractor for about 5 months who taught me some stretches and self-adjustments I could do with a back roller and now I've trained myself not to panic when I feel those chest pains. Just do the stretches and trust that I'm fine and sure enough, I am. Also, my doctor told me to cut caffeine and I didn't listen. I am a coffee junkie and cut back, but didn't cut it out entirely. Well recently I switched to decaf (I know, stick with me) and it's been life-changing. Yes, this is obvious. Yes, we all know caffeine raises your physiological arousal level. But many of us keep consuming caffeine not realizing just *how* much it actually contributes to the cycle. I'm a much happier person on decaf and I don't think I'll go back. I found out all of the shit I was dealing with can be caused by anxiety. So this whole time, it was the fear of a health problem that was causing health problems. Stress impacts us more than we realize!

So to recap, here are the things my dumb ass put off doing forever that really made a huge impact:

-Get a doctor's opinion. As in, a thorough one if possible instead of just a quick visit. They will run some tests and give you a professional take on it. When you get this - TRUST IT. If you have reason to believe the doctor missed something, get a second opinion but really you should trust the doctor.

-Manage your external stress. This doesn't mean quit your job, but if something is stressing you out (a situation at work, a significant other, family) take some real steps to get out of that situation! In my case it was a lateral transfer and a change in responsibilities but man did it lower my stress levels.

-Cut the caffeine and any other stimulants including recreational ones. If you struggle with anxiety, your brain is already pumping you full of stress hormones in a fight-or-flight response. You absolutely do not to make it worse. Even a little can impact some people (like me, apparently).

-For the love of Reddit, never Google your symptoms.

The terrible thing about anxiety is once it has you, it's a downward spiral. But the inverse is true too. Once you are confident in your situation and know the quirks of your own body, you can come out of it quickly too. Hope this helps someone.",2
how long does depression last after getting fired? I was fired early February and I have been so depressed ever since. I have nightmares about it at least once a week. I'm in school full time and had to drop one of my classes because I was failing so badly. I have no willingness to do my homework at all. idk what to do.

"Pulsatile tinnitus So over the last week or so I've noticed that for about 10-15 seconds each day, I've heard a pulsing sound in my ear that sounds like a fan whirring. At first I thought it was an external sound, but then I pinned it down to coming from inside my head when I was in the bathroom one time. I googled it and it came up with pulsatile tinnitus, and it said the cause could be tumours, aneurysms, high blood pressure, hearing loss etc. 

I hear it in my right ear, and as I said it's normally for around 10 seconds a day at random times. I've been unable to trigger it or find a way to induce it; there seems to be no pattern to it. Which is odd because people who mention this talk of it being constant.  

I exercise regularly and do cardio, and I'm cutting down on my caffeine consumption to see if that helps. I've heard this can be a symptom of anxiety or can just be heightened awareness of my own body, which makes sense but don't exactly know what that means. You'd think I'd have noticed this before. 

Anyone experienced this before? ",2

"HA over some yogurt I just ate I opened up a new container of yogurt today (one of those big 2 lb ones) and when I did, I noticed there was some liquid, as well as tiny holes covering the entire surface - almost as if there were bubbles that gathered on top and then popped leaving behind tiny indentations. 

I’m not so worried about the liquid since that’s common, but I’m wondering what those holes were. I scraped off the top layer and the yogurt underneath seemed fine so I ate it, but now I can’t stop thinking about the possibility it might have been bad.

"Can’t stop worrying about severe illness, cancer, surgery, and anesthesia failure - think I’m going to jinx it happening by stopping worrying about it. This is pretty superstitious, but basically it’s the fear of the fact that often things happen when you least expect them, so I’m afraid to stop expecting them to happen in order to control them into not happening.  

The other thing is that if I stop worrying about them, I get comfortable and attached to my lifestyle, and then if something happens, it’s going to be more of a letdown.  This already happened this year.  I got a very small Pilonidal Cyst (now on track to get a minor procedure to remove it), and at first I was devastated - mostly because for a while I had forgotten about the possibility of these things happening, so there was more of a shock value.  I’m afraid of the shock factor of enjoying my life and being hit with cancer versus expecting it all along and hopefully mitigating a bit of it.",2
"So I have been struggling with suicidal thoughts for a while now, and even attempted to in April. Unfortunately I was never seen. My friends were worried about me and offered to help.

"So, a bit about me: I am a 21 year old guy. Grew up in a family that strongly believes in academics to be the most important thing in life. Consequently, I had no lack of support from them for my studies, rather, saying ""I want to study"" was a common excuse for me to not do my chores. While I say excuse, I loved to study. We did not have internet or television, so most of what I read was textbooks provided by our school, and sometimes novels I took out of the school library. My school grades were top notch. The school itself was highly competitive, but when I graduated from high school, I had the fifth highest score in the school. Pretty good, everyone expects me to do well. I also did well in some entrance exams and got into a top university, studying CompSci.But that is where the happiness stops. The university is terrible at teaching, and that demotivated me from studying the subjects all by myself. The result? Terrible. My grades dropped. But still, they were not that terrible in my first year. I had a fail grade in one subject which I cleared. But then, that one fail grade completely demotivated me. I stopped paying attention to classes, and eventually stopped going to them. My friends and some of the better professors would ask me what is wrong, and I would do my best to avoid them. Eventually, I was scared to even go out lest I will meet some of my classmates or teachers. And the result was obvious, I failed all the classes that semester.Now, I was too scared to tell this to my family. They were bad enough when I had one failed subject last time, and warned me that I will be not allowed to continue studying and waste their money if I just wanted to fail. So I showed a fake grade sheet. And yes, they want to see the grade sheet or they will not pay for the next semester. I thought I would maybe clear those subjects one by one and they would not know. But now the shame of missing most of the classes in the last semester caught up, and I realised I could not concentrate in the classes at all. No one would talk to me voluntarily, and they would just answer very short when I ask something, and sometimes will not even do that. So eventually, that semester got fucked too.And this happened the next time too. I failed most of the subjects and had to fake my grades. But the university had terminated me, and I had to appeal for them to reinstate me. They did, and I had to retake the previous years subjects. But I did not know anyone from the class, and again, could not concentrate. I had planned to kill myself in the end of summer semester 2020, but because of the pandemic, we had to go back home. Back home, I pretended to be attending lectures while doing something else on my laptop. The last year I attended exactly 0 classes.Of course, my family thinks I am studying, but I am not. Remember I said I loved to read? Now I cannot even fucking concentration on reading something. Every night when I sleep, I promise myself that I will start studying tomorrow, but that never happens. The moment I open my textbook or some website to study, I lose all motivation. I cannot do it.Today was supposed to be the day I graduate and receive my degree. My family does not know. And they are one phone call away from knowing. we are not too rich, we cannot afford a regular psychiatrist. And anyway, I will be the one blamed, because that is how it has always been here. If I score low in a paper, it is because I did not study enough, not because I had a fever. I had a fever because I am too lazy to study. What do you think I will get when I say ""I have been failing for three years, I have just been faking my grades.""? I do not even have enough skills to find a job, and no one wants to hire a student who failed three years and could not get help for himself. And academics was the only thing I was ever good at.Frankly, every night I pray that I will not wake up alive. I do not have the guts to slice my wrist or stab myself in the heart or hang myself or something else. I have came close to completing those things, but I just cannot do it. I have ruined my life, and I hate myself.",1

"Frustrating set back with HA Looking for some support right now! My health anxiety started in the midst of some real health concerns. I was eventually diagnosed with a tumor in my pituitary and am currently taking medication to deal with that. Even so I developed severe HA, concentrated around having a heart condition. 

I ended up in the hospital once and in urgent care half a dozen times over the course of 6 months. I also went to see my GP several times during this period. Every time an EKG was done and it came out normal. At the urging of GP I went to see a psychiatrist and therapist. 

I’ve been on Zoloft for about 8 weeks now. The beginning was rough but lately I’ve felt great. One of my biggest triggers has been my blood pressure, and it’s been weeks since I checked it. I was checking my BP just about every 10 minutes before. I was also afraid to exert myself, but have been able to start exercising again, which feels great. 

Last night things went off the rails. My usual symptoms- pain in my upper left chest, arm pain/numbness, and crushing fear all returned. I checked my BP several times and was only able to fall asleep when I collapsed from exhaustion. I took a klonopin, which I have so I can deal with panic attacks like last night. 

Today I’ve been feeling anxious the entire day, I’ve resisted taking klonopin again because I don’t want to become dependent on it. I feel incredibly frustrated. I have come such a long way in the last few weeks and I’m afraid I’m falling back into my old ways. 

I’m going back to my psych on Friday but I’m scared of spending the week in a near constant panic. Has anyone else experienced something similar? How did you deal with it and do you have any advice that can help? Having HA is like living in your own personal hell and I really don’t feel like I can go back to what my life was like before. ",2

For a week now I've had a stiff neck, this has been accompanied by cold hands and feet and random pains in my limbs, I also got off an antibiotic a week ago for a tooth infection.

"Overcoming personal anxiety by helping others Long time HA sufferer and poster. I am fortunate enough to say I have managed my HA enough to a point where it’s not consistently affecting my life. Just want to share a few pearls. 

Our health anxiety is very self centered. We obsess over health , our bodies, etc. the key to recovery is to stop focusing on ourselves. More on this later. 

Everybody on here is a bit different. I personally feel a sense of relief with medical testing , doctor visits etc; but some are fearful of those things. For that reason this post may not apply to you. 

A lot of us are in the medical field. I myself am a dentist and have had the irony of dealing with hypochondriacs in my office who are worried about oral cancer. 

Examining a fearful patient the other day , and reassuring him that he does not have oral cancer, gave me an epiphany of sorts, which led me to the following. 

Today I joined the national bone marrow donation match website. It’s a wonderful opportunity to help out people that are going through what we all in this sub fear the most- terminal cancer. 

Think about it, you can save a life!Minimal procedure. A needle in your hip. Some painkillers and you are on your way. 

Not only that but there’s such a barrage of testing beforehand that you can all but be guaranteed that you don’t have any sort of underlying illness. (They only take 18-44 year old healthy donors for the most part ) all of the testing is free and meals and rides are covered. 

I don’t know if I’ll ever get called but the whole thing puts my personal health anxieties in perspective.  To save a child’s life from leukemia, for example, would forever change your life. 

I’m not saying you need to do this. But take the focus away from yourself. Whether it’s through charity, or through work, school, gym; I promise you will stop obsessing over your headache, leg twitch, or your heart flutter. I still have bad days but overall I can say I’ve improved a great deal from this philosophy.",2

"100% sure i have hiv To start it off im a 17 year old male who had unprotected sex with a women i met from the internet (yeah i know im a dumbass) in her 20's 48 days ago. She said she was clean and even sent me a test she took febuary 5th saying she was negative. But then she blocked me. Now she could of done that because i pissed her  off constantly asking if she had hiv or she did it because she found out she did and did not want to be sued. 
two weeks after the sex my anxiety kicked in and i thought i had every symptom but a week later i found out that i had a 0.04% chance of contracting it, so it went away. fast forward to today, i am having daily headaches sometimes accompianed my nausa(huge hiv sympom). i had a 98% fever for one day last week and also had a leg cramp one day and sometimes would get some aches in my arm (maybe hiv or anxiety). 

Im scared out of my mind right now. The only reason i had sex was because i was feeling kind of depressed and thought sex would help. Little did i know that i was going to contract hiv from it :(. I will be a medical phenomenom, i can already see the headlines ""17 year old depressed boy has sex to make himself feel better, ends up contracting HIV instead"".

"Spinning out with health anxiety Hi all,

New post, struggling big time with health anxiety, to the point that it is becoming hard to cope.

I'm 36 years, old, I have two kids, currently nursing a 1 year old. About 4-6 months ago, I started losing weight. Initially I thought nothing of it, I figured it was just being a busy mom!

But fast forward and within that time, I caught just the most random viruses, and badly. I caught a flu that immediately turned to pneumonia. I caught a viral rash from my 4 year old niece. My weight kept dropping.

At this point, I started to become understandably anxious and curious as to what was happening. I had bloodwork during my pneumonia that came back ""normal"" in her eyes. But I noticed today there was elevated platelet count and low lymphocytes. Which are commonly linked to cancer of some sort. Why did I google it?

I'm just spinning out, because I lost my dad recently to a very rare aggressive cancer. Something just doesn't add up. I'm just scared that it is something seriously wrong. I'm getting more bloodwork done to hopefully alleviate my worries now that I am healthy... it could just have been related to the pneumonia, and the weight loss to nursing, anxiety and being a busy mom. But I can't see her until next week, and it is just torturous waiting.  

Any tips on how to cope? Similar experiences?",2

"I cheated lied and hurt people near and dear to me. Now everyone knows my lies and I do not feel like breathing, walking, or looking anyone in the eyes. My spouse cheated on me a long time ago, after which things became pretty good. She was nice to me, worked her way to get me back, and make me love her. Which I did for about 3-4 years and then I started feeling the urge to have someone else in my life and see what it feels like to be with someone else than my wife. I went down the worse path, I lied to someone about my marriage being in turmoil and how I still feel neglected by my spouse. I started giving more time to the affair over calls and WhatsApp, instead of providing the necessary time to my wife and daughter.

Recently everyone found out about this, as the woman I was involved with was talking to me while her husband was home. Now her husband informed everything to my wife. I am constantly trying to say sorry and ask for forgiveness. My wife is talking to the other women and she is providing more details about what I used to say and not. 

During this affair sometimes I will feel weird about patching up with my wife but will stop myself and withdraw myself because I used to feel it was unjust to her while I am in another relationship. To touch her kiss her or even say I loved her. I am this horrible human being and I feel I don't deserve any of them. 

Now I have a hard time just living let alone working. I wish my wife forgives me. I tried talking her into marriage counseling but her point is you have mental issues, why should she suffer?

Cant look into my daughter's eyes (she doesn't know anything). Same with Mom. My only support system in the world after I lost my dad this year was my brother. He knows everything about this now and is withdrawn from me, and anyway, he lives in a different country. 

I will be ok living alone too, I mean I will understand if my wife leaves me now. She has not decided anything yet. But to stay like this, it's difficult, do I have a right to live? Is there any hope for a monster like me? Please help if you think I am still worth living and loving.",1

They do not care if YOU are feeling it, only that you do not share it. it is not the depression that bothers people. it is when you talk about it.",1

"It had taken me four years to recover from the breakdown I had, and until recently, I would been doing so well in terms of mental health. But all of a sudden, the depression has hit me like a ton of bricks. I have been looking for a job, but it is like as soon as they hear the reason I left my last job was for mental health reasons, they do not want anything to do with me even though I am definitely qualified and experienced for it.I have no relationship prospects at all. I have been avoiding it all because I cannot bear the thought of hurting someone else with my issues, but the loneliness is too much to handle sometimes.I still live at home, and have to deal with a fair amount of stress, but I cannot move out because I have no job, so I am stuck here for a lot longer than I would like.I love my friends and family so much, and wish them nothing but the absolute best, but it hurts to see everyone so happy with their lives and moving on to bigger and better things while I am stuck in reverse.And everyone around the world has lost so much due to Covid among other things, so I feel guilty about complaining about my situation when it is a paradise compared to what others have been through. I am just sad. I feel like there is no light at the end of the tunnel and my life is slipping away from me. I would been doing so well until now",1

"Maybe you do have a health condition, but it's more likely to be benign/chronic than whatever you're imagining I used to have bad health anxiety. Until I was diagnosed with POTS: postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.

What is POTS? At it's core, it's an increase in heartrate when you're standing. To be diagnosed you need to have a standing heartrate that's 30+bpm higher than your supine (lying down) heartrate.

But what is POTS really? It's a complex condition of the autonomic nervous system. There are dozens of possible symptoms, all somewhat benign, ranging from heart palpitations to nausea to trouble regulating temperature. Some people with POTS aren't affected much while others are confined to a wheelchair because of their fainting spells. Yes it can be a terrible experience, but it is *not fatal.*

So why am I telling you guys this?

Because there's a 100 conditions like POTS. Simple, relatively ""harmless"" conditions that make you feel uncomfortable, but pose no risk to your life. To name a few:

* Raynauds disease - intensely cold fingers/toes
* Fibromyalgia - pain/aches in muscles
* Arthritis - pain in bones
* Asthma - difficulty breathing
* TMJ - jaw pain, headaches
* Crohn's disease - abdominal pain, gas, diarrhea, vomiting
* Cyclic vomiting disease - recurring vomiting spells
* Ovarian cysts - pain in pelvis, back or side
* Hypothyroidism - fatigue, weight gain, hair loss
* Anemia - fatigue, coldness
* Sleep apnea - sleepiness, snoring

I'm not saying that it's easy to live with these conditions. No way. Most of them suck. HOWEVER, they are not cancer, they are not heart disease, they are not multiple sclerosis.

So when you're listing your symptoms, focus on what the *most probably cause*. Neck pain? You probably have ""text neck"". Stomachache? You probably ate something that your stomach doesn't agree with. Headache? You probably have some environmental or dietary trigger.

/r/healthanxiety is very near and dear to my heart. I spent many anxious nights terrified because of heart palpitations, difficulty breathing, muscle cramps. I can't tell you how much of a weight off my shoulders its been to have a diagnosis. (I should've mentioned that the caused of my POTS is mitochondrial dysfunction, which comes with another huge slew of symptoms)

I hope anyone here with an undiagnosed chronic condition can find a diagnosis and treatment asap. I know it's hard to keep your head on straight until that happens, but try to! You are your best advocate.

"I am so depressed and my suicidal ideations have never been this strong. I lost a lot of meaningful friendships this past month and a half, and now I feel disconnected from everything and everyone. I am in the process of trying to get settled in with my new roommates in a new apartment, but due to certain circumstances I still cannot move stuff into my room, and actually get all moved in. Seeing all my things sprawled around, not being able to have my own space, and not being able to know when or how Ill get settled is making me so incredibly restless. On top of that I am currently dealing with a back injury that is keeping me from going to work, and that also sucks immensely. Genuinely I have tried to get better and be patient and try to keep a positive outlook on life but honestly it just seems like its one thing after the other. Not only am I dealing with a lot of changes and stress, I am also dealing with really severe depression and anxiety causing me constant distress and now I am dealing with mild spouts of dissociative symptoms, where I start questioning everything and realize that I honestly am not present for half of the shit I do. I literally have no more meaningful friendships, or a close relationship with my family so it sucks dealing with all of this without any means of support, emotionally and physically. Honestly I have nothing worth keeping me alive for, literally nothing lol.

I live with my fiance, but he's had health struggles this year, as well as difficulties at work, so he has leaned on me daily, breaking down and panicking before work, calling me for 30-90 minutes a few times a week while I'm at work, breaking down when he gets home from work...after about 20 minutes each time I get overwhelmed and frustrated, but I signal anger. Then he says he feels like he has no support, so I feel like my efforts are wasted.

I have my own problems. But I shove them down and go to work, clean the house, make dinner, basically do the things that need to be done every day. I shoulder the mental load in our household.

"I guess technically I have already known that depression sticks around for life, but it is still a bummer every time it resurfaces. I have made major steps toward improving my mental health over the past 5 years or so, and I would even say that I have experienced momentary happiness from time to time. But here I am again, struggling through each day just like I did for most of my life. I guess I cannot really complain, because now I know it is possible to feel better again, so I do not have serious suicidal thoughts anymore. The frustrating part is that it seems like no matter how many times I crawl out of this hole, I always fall back in eventually. Given that I am not even 20 years old yet, I am dreading the vast number of depressive episodes ahead of me. It never stops, does it?",1

"Does it really ever get better? I left the one person I kept feeling like would always be there for me. I feel like I was too picky but also just not sure if it was my own anxiety that caused me to doubt and ultimately lose him. I keep looking around and seeing all the ways he cared for me. All the little gifts and sentiments. I know people say to throw them out but I cannot bare to. My life improved when I was with him. I know it was always in me but he supported me when I needed it most. I saw everyone tell me my relationship was 110% better than the relationship of my parents and close friends. But I know I cannot use comparison. We had our dark times too. How can I keep going this way without him. Maybe everything was an illusion, part of a beautiful dream or dark twisted nightmare. I can feel okay when I need to. I pull myself forward. Yet in between it all the dark feelings keep coming. Like ink stained spreading across a page. All I want is to feel okay again. And know that I will be fine. Struggling with mental health, financial and family issues, and a failed relationship",1

"Despite my mom and grandma both having depression in the past, they are so rude about it all. Any time I mention I feel sad they say Why? You have a great life, you have everything. I know I am lucky but its an illness for a reason!! It does not discriminate! I told my mom today my depression is not going away, that I have tried three different antidepressants and none of them work. She told me I am being dramatic. Wtf? Just because antidepressants work for her does not mean they do for me. She has severe mental illness, me and my siblings know this already. she is a control freak, talks to herself, drinks wine every day despite having fatty liver disease, and is extremely paranoid. My mom and grandma are the ones who passed down this shitty gene to me in the first place because depression and anxiety run in their side of the family. When I told my mom I am getting tested for ADHD because I swear to god I have it, every inattentive symptom describes me, she told me I was trying to find things wrong with me. Wtf. The more I think about it the more I think she has ADHD too. Girls are underdiagnosed after all Unsupportive family",1

I’m tired, I’m scared and I don’t know how to end this cycle and actually do my work.

"How do I learn how to control/ get rid of stress when there are so many things which could be causing it I’m 13 and for the past 5 months , since august, I haven’t been able to sleep properly and my period has completely gone and my hairs falling out a lot  and I’m positive it’s because of stress . The problem is idk what actually causing my stress because I have so many problems 

I’ve had blood tests and they just said I have  anaemia (low iron). 

I’m always anxious when I can’t sleep because I start ruminating about the consequences of poor sleep and that makes it harder to sleep but idk if that anxiety around sleep is causing my stress 

Even when I do have a good nights sleep I still feel nervous and can’t seem to calm down I’m always stuck in my head and can’t seem to enjoy the present moment because I’m always listening to my negative thoughts 

There have been so many things wich  overwhelm me , like my moms 39 weeks pregnant with her 6th kid and my parents don’t have time to give me attention and they don’t believe that I’m struggling mentally.
And I’ve recently had a fall out with a friend and now she’s spreading rumours about me and my sister keeps body shaming me when I’m already struggling with body image and calories 

Everything makes me feel so overwhelmed and I don’t know how to cope anymore I have no adults  I can tell this to except my parents who don’t give af and I have no family where I live 

Can someone pls give me advice",3

"I cannot manage to make my happiness stay for a long while. Something within me is pulling it, and now I am just so used at depriving (it came in naturally) myself from smiling. It all started last year, it has something to do with a ""major decision"" in my life. During the last 5 months of the previous year, I never let my mind go idle, I get myself busy with school works, but the pain just resurfaces and it sure feels legitimate and new. Fast forward to this year, half of 2021 had passed, I thought I would be able to move forward as that is what I have fervently prayed for during the preceding year, to my disappointment, it is still the same. I am not surprised either, I always knew when I firstly experienced it, that this pain will never fade away, it may subside, but it will surely regain its intensity and resurfaces once again. I cannot open this to someone else, they would just simply say to ""get over it."" Well, I KNOW that I have to, but it still really feels heavy and heavier as time marches on. I honestly want to isolate myself for a moment, I want to have that episodes and years of solitude in my life where I let these thoughts run on my mind continuously without worrying about wasting such time that I would supposedly for being productive, with the hopes that it would be of help to evaluate and make me feel more at ease and to move on. My issue might be too ""petty"" to some for it to be shared, but please this is only my safest space to somehow breathe.I need help, I cannot cry anymore, it is tiring and there are no tears left. I am literally ""dead inside"" Idk what to do (regrets)",1

"The flu is going around really badly at my university and I'm terrified of catching it I'm really freaking myself out a lot. I have a good immune system, I normally only get one cold or so a year, haven't had the stomach bug in almost 7 years (knock on wood), and I don't think I've ever had the flu (but maybe a flu like illness or two).

Anyway, I'm always health anxious about things like this, but it got a lot worse last week upon receiving an email that the flu is widespread and that they've been getting a large amount of cases. People in my classes claim to have it, people in my clubs claim to have it, etc. Luckily none of my five roommates (we live and share a bathroom together) have gotten it so far, but I'm still so freaked out. I obviously go above and beyond with precautions- hand washing before any kind of eating or touching my face, probiotics, Vitamin C immune supplements 1x a day, lots of fruit, water, sleep, not a lot of junk food, exercise. I clean the doorknobs every day and sanitize my phone and laptop daily. I still can't help but worry.

I've been taking my temperature a lot and feeling feverish but it never comes back with a fever. I've also had some trouble sleeping and I've been nauseous, had a funky appetite, and some questionable poops. You can catch the flu through air droplets so that's the only way I think I could ever get it but I'm still really freaked out.

Any advice on how to try and relax a bit?",2

"New to this. Need coping skills Hello, I am new to this community, but I wanted some help. 

I’ll start with some context. I’ve always been a person that throws up and a lot of the time it was when I was nervous. This past year tho it has gotten much worse, with a time where I even went to the hospital because I hadn’t eaten in like 2 days and I felt so physically exhausted and dehydrated. At first I thought it was from weed and something called CHS, but quitting weed didn’t really make a difference. I also have delt with this vommiting in highschool before I would go to a party I would get so nervous I would puke. And that was before I ever touched weed.

This led me to go to a gastro doctor who said he did not think it was weed related and instead some inflammation in intestines. I’ve been on meds for that for 3 months but it was getting better and I really started to take my anxiety seriously  so I went to my doctor and they prescribed me an SSRI. I also will start therapy in a few weeks here. For the past month (after about 1.5 month on SSRI) I have been doing better. I hadn’t thrown up for a month, but these past 2 nights I have had very panic attack like feelings and tonight even pushed me to the point where I had to get up from being comforted by my girlfriend to throw up. And I always feel awful about it and like it’s going to just keep happening and I think I get stuck in that cycle.

Does anyone have any tips/advice on dealing with this before my therapy appointment I thought I was doing so good but now I’m afraid I’m slipping back.",2
"People come and go constantly, and who might have been a close, best friend for several weeks or months just suddenly do not reach out or say anything to you anymore. You get ghosted. People use you up and just move on from you when they feel that they are done with you or got what they want from you. And then we get told that we must constantly be out and about, doing things all the time every single day and meet new people and make new friends, and the cycle just continues over and over. Some people do not want to be friends with you, some flake out from the beginning, others stick around but for only a little bit, couple of years at best. what is the point? we are naturally social creatures and even the most solitary of people crave interaction, but what does it really give us in the end? Sure, a fun memory or two at most, but is that it? All these movies, songs, anime etc preach about the value of friendship and about friends that stick with you no matter what, congrats, those people either do not exist or they are rare to find. Especially now with the dawn of smartphones, streaming etc, nobody wants to commit anymore, nobody wants friends anymore.

"Hi I am 32 M, dropped out soon after starting my undergrad. Now I have a job and all but I am lacking happiness... I enjoy the challenge and and everything but as my work ends everyday I realize I have nothing... I am living with my parents but we hardly talk and Everytime I do initiate, I am responded with tales of how I messed up my life did not pursue a degree cannot get a high paid job and all... 4 years back I started dating a friend and I guess today we broke up... The reason, she thinks I am sexually attracted to every girl on my friendlist on Facebook. Now everyone is different and everyone have their own personalities and comforts... Some of my friends do not hesitate to publish pictures that make them look and feel sensual... My take on that is everyone has their freedom to do anything and everything as long as it does not because harm to the community and or to another living being I am not bothered with it. But my gf thinks there is more going on... To help ease her with her feelings till date she asked and I have blocked 8 friends on spot for no apparent reason just to ease her... I have isolated myself with long-term friends because she suspected me to have an affair with their younger sisters... I have always had an helpful nature but over the last 4 years I have not helped a single female which led to my coworkers questioning my sexuality... Even at office she asked me pics of my sitting arrangement and upon seeing it asked me to move my desk as their wad a girl next to mine... It would have been awkward for me to change my desk at that point instead I had to change her team and reporting boss so that she sat next to him... But now after doing all that today we broke up because another friend of mine commented on my status on fb who seemed to have an attractive dp which again led her to believe I am involved with her physically... Even after sharing all my passwords and IDs, my banking information and everything she still thinks I am spending money on other women which I clearly do not...So yeah from not a high paid job, no education and now no partner, nothing's doing me any good... Maybe I am crying out for some sympathy here but I am not lying when I say I am lost... I was a cheerful person who was passionate about dancing (though I was never good at it) but now I have got no passion for nothing...Oh I had to lose my passion for dance because my ex and I used to dance together and yes back then I was involved with her physically and would often participate in making love but when she lost her affection towards me (plus started cheating on me) I was understanding enough and have no ill feelings for her... because the heart wants what the heart wants I only wished she had spoken to me before cheating but that was her decision to make... So my current gf ever since then asked me not to watch dance videos/shows anything that adds fuel to my passion... Side note I did not have sex with my current gf but I did tell her that I am very much attracted to her and would like to do it. She asked me to not ask this of her before marriage and I do respect that. In the last 4 years I have probably asked her for it only thrice.... Except for the first time the other two both ended with very bad arguments and name callings from her end... The most we have done is kiss and that is all.... I am sorry if all this seems pathetic but it is how it is and I cannot help it neither can I stand it anymore.... If anyone reads the entire thing, THANKYOU it meant a lot.... Desperate for hope",1

"Can’t handle this feeling I found a small black dot under my big toe nail. Like a sharpie dot. I googled and it could be a very rare but serious form of skin cancer. If it grows out, it’s just a blood blister. If not, it could be skin cancer. I don’t recall stubbing my toe. I’m 28, Caucasian but not super fair haired/eyed/skin. 
Ugh, I can’t wait to see if it grows out. But I also feel ridiculous going to the doctor for a black dot. 
I wake up in the mornings with the sickening thought that I have skin cancer and it ruins my day. My stomach is gurgled and in knots and I’m convinced the cancer has spread.

"At one point I was having fun doing these things. Its true that robotics competition taught me useful skills like how to code and build, but I was more obsessed with actually winning than learning. Unfortunately for younger me, school teams coaches were focused on ensuring every student learned something and I never had teammates that were super passionate about winning the competition. In hindsight, Its not like winning really mattered anyway. Now for video games, i do not think playing them is bad until you start playing them to avoid your problems in real life or with the dream to go pro in some esport title. I wish I had realized that before i spent thousands of hours alone in front of the screen honing my skills. I never actually stuck to the same game either, i just played whatever was trending at my school during the time. I suppose I was the best there at competitive, but that is a pretty meaningless title. Compared to the rest of the country I am nothing.I used anime/tv and youtube as a means to escape reality as well. I did not make new friends in high school and would watch stuff for 3-4 hours a day (while maintaining my grades so my parents would not kill me)I tried to be a youtuber/streamer just like every other internet kid but that takes talent and effort over timeI also spent a lot of time trying being a game dev but i lacked the skill. I had a little success trading on steam but i still consider that time wasted because its not a very useful skill.I did manage to lose weight and get in better shape and got into a good computer science program but I have lost my passion for programming and math. Its just become a thing i do at this point. I have started to have binge eating episodes and currently am on medication. It seems to have numbed my feelings. I occasionally feel intense despair and hunger but that is about it, usually i feel nothing.I have been to counseling but i just do not care enough to go anymore, what more can they do than say everyone makes mistakes. you are still so young and can make a ton of friends in college. do not compare yourself to others. What even is a friend anyway? Also do not really have a great relationship with my parents if you have not guessed alreadyI do not have any skills that can get me paid other than programming. I hope i start enjoying it again soon. I am interested in entrepreneurship but its not the most safe thing to pursueTL;DR I wish i was more productive and social as a kid instead of a loner that grinded pointless tasks. Also lost passion for current major but too afraid to switch. Feels like I am headed for a boring life.

"I recently got diagnosed with GAD and need help with how to cope with potential panic attacks Monday I have a panic attack and was diagnosed with GAD. 

I'm only 18 years old and I do stress and I have had anxiety before but not that I've had a full on panic attack I feel like it's taking over my everyday things.

Last night I had one and this morning when I woke up I almost had one but I managed through it.

So far I've been outside and that helps me but doesn't make it go away fully.

I went to eat at a restaurant and right when I walked it I got panicky and couldn't eat my food because I couldn't hold it down and I had to swallow the 2 bites I did take WITH WATER.

I know this is temporary and I plan to work out and get a therapist and MAYBE take meds but is there anything I can remember to know for next time?

It hasn't been a full week and I've had 2 panic attack and almost another.

I'm anxious about being anxious cause that will trigger a possible attack

Panic attacks make it feel like I'm having a heart attack or anything life threating.

I should enjoy life but ik this is something that will take some time to deal with.

My hands shake a little and I still have a fast heart beat even when I don't feel panicky. It also feels like a pit in my stomach is waiting for a thought to pop up for me to panic.

When waking up today I panicked and walking it off reminded me of Monday when I walking and had the panic attack.

Anything I should know for next time?",2

It's like I'm binging too. She always excuses herself to the bathroom right after a meal and I know she's purging. The more recent time I hung out with her, I put my foot down a little more and told her i didn't want to pay for so much food, and that I wasn't doing shots (I never do shots, but she always orders them for me when I'm out with her and then is really manipulative in order to pressure me to do them).",0

Like, cannot I just feel something other than disappointment and self-hatred for once. I think this passing few months my mental health has taken a nosedive. I have thought about ways to kill myself and I have planned out scenarios in my mind in intricate details I never thought I would be able to. I am too scared to go through with any of them because I do not want to make my parents sad, but if I died right here right now of some freak accident out of my control I am down for it. Yeah, last time I cried I remember it was not even tears rolling down the eyes. It was not genuine. It was more sympathy than anything. This sucks, I think I can change sometimes but I never do.

I pay for all the bills, including rent in a shitty duplex we have lived in since I was in high school that has so many problems but considering I am the only one paying bills, I cannot afford anything better. It would literally be cheaper and more freeing to be living with an actual roommate that splits the cost of everything instead of my mother who pays for nothing, but I cannot.To top it all off, she is smothering. She gets offended if I do not want to spend every waking minute not at work talking to her and will cry and throw fits if I just want to be by myself. She treats me like I am 16 rather than 30 and paying all her bills and literally throwing my life away to make sure that she has a place to live.I am just so depressed. I have no time for me. I rarely go out because my friends all think I am weird for living at home, and fuck trying to have a romantic relationship. My life is essentially over until she either dies or I win the lottery and I hate thinking that but its the truth. Idk. I am sad and had to get this off my chest.

"For the last 2 Months I have been really struggling. Everyone in my life thinks things are getting better and that I am starting to get a handle on my depression but really I have just been telling a series of lies so no one realises how low I have fallen.I do not know how to make it better. I keep telling myself if I can just get my home cleaned up, if I can just get myself to go to work, if I can just make one little step forward then everything will be okay. But that one little step is either never enough or to hard to make.I am now at a point where I have been off work for 2 weeks and tomorrow I am going to have to go back and I know that as soon as I walk through the door Ill be fired. I get it. And I have made what plans I can to get by but I hate myself so much for letting it get to this point. I always wonder why cannot I be appreciative of the opportunities I have. Maybe if I was more grateful I would not mess up so much.I really need some support and words of encouragement to carry me through what I know Is going to be a hard day tomorrow. I really hope there is someone out there to read this because I just cannot be alone anymore. I cannot handle it all alone anymore. About to be fired",1

"Disclaimer: I don't intend to bad-mouth Mirtazapine here, its side effects and somewhat ""dulling"" effect on the mind for some people (during the first few months) has likely been discussed enough here. Some feel nothing at all, others feel like zombies. Totally individual. I trust and maintain that the benefits of proper use, together with conversational therapy, is very efficient for many people, and I hope this has been said on this sub. I feel a need to share my own experience, though, in the hopes that it will be of some help to someone who might be reacting the same way as I did to Mirtazapine's well-recorded increase in appetite.",0

I am hanging on by a thread and can’t find a good therapist. I have been at this going on 2 yrs. I have been optimistic and from what I found out therapy doesn’t really work and I have gotten the same feedback from other ppl.

"Hello there, I am 17 going off to college at the end of summer and just need some advice on what to do:)I have always been somewhat depressed and I have attempted at sophomore year of highschool(cops were called, etc.). However my parents reaction to it is something that I do not really understand. My father never talks about it, but my mom was the one who tried to make me feel better by telling me that others have it worse(people with no parents, money, limbs, etc.) and my reaction was ""over the line"". She even discovered my cutting scars and told me that I was crazy like a mental person. I even came out to her during this time but she rejected it completely, calling it gross and that I will grow out of the phase. Moving to rn,I try to do things I enjoy such as makeup, getting clothes, or hanging/talking to friends (stuff that I missed out on the first two years) I feel as though my parents want me to do things their way. One instance I was practicing doing heavy makeup since it is something I do not do often and my parents immediately started to discuss how I would be raped on campus and that I should not do time wasting things. Same things about my clothes, even though they are not revealing and I sometimes wear oversized clothes and big boots which they also openly do not like. This comes up many times, when I opened up to my dad about talking to a Muslim friend that I knew for two years and how he would ""ruin my life"" by raping me and I was not permitted to talk to him. It feels that my parents are pressuring me to live my life their way and it is taking me back to the dark place I was freshman and sophomore year. Any tips/advice on how to handle this situation would be heavily appreciated. Need help for confusing situation",1
"Well Reddit, I don't even know where to begin... I guess I will start at the start of my relationship with my now wife and mother of my beautiful little girl.

"Horrible Fear of Food Being Drugged Lately I’ve been having this massively irrational fear of my food being laced with LSD or some other form of psychedelics.  I won’t eat something that’s been already opened regardless of whether or not it’s mine, which has led to me not only wasting food, but actively avoiding eating unless I make it right there, and even then it takes quite a bit of effort.  This in turn has also led me to having a fear of an undiagnosed mental illness, and I can’t quite afford to go to a doctor currently to figure out if that is the case.

I’ve only ever been technically “drugged” once when the cannabis my friend bought was laced with PCP a few months ago but this fear extends back to when I was around fifteen (twenty three now).  I’ve done acid only twice and while I did enjoy it, it’s not something I’m likely to do again, and I rarely smoke cannabis or drink, but I did do a lot of both for a few years.

  Obviously nobody is gonna waste good acid on me but the fear is constantly there to the point that I yelled at my brother the other day for jokingly pretending to drop something into my Gatorade on the way to work (he’s unaware of this fear) and threw it away despite it being completely full, and even avoided eating the cookies my mom brought down for Christmas, which made me feel awful as there is absolutely no way my mom would ever do anything like that to me.

I’m iffy on telling anybody close to me about this fear for a few reasons, the main one being the irrationality of it all, but I also do not want to be sent to an inpatient center (again, can’t afford it) as I was for depression as a minor.  Sorry for the rambling wall of text but I just need to know if this is signs of a more major illness or at the very least how I can possibly cope with it.",2

"Why can't my mom see that I'm depressed? Hello

I've been having this issue for years now and it seems to make everything worse than it should be. 

I've been trying to reach out for help for 7 years now (I'm 21 now). I've been trying to tell my mom what's happening, telling her why I can't seem to get out of bed for days on end sometimes, telling her that I need help, and everytime the conversation happens it feels like she finally gets what I'm saying. She never does. Everytime she gets upset at me she asks why I'm always in bed, why a person my age is always tired and never really doing anything or going anywhere,  and Everytime it just makes me feel both worse and insane. I've straight up told her that I've thought/attempted suicide before and all she had to say was ""oh really?"" in a tone that suggested that I didn't have it hard enough to do that. 

I don't understand why she keeps doing this, why she keeps asking me what's wrong when I've told her a thousand times. It's making me feel like I'm making everything up, that I'm going crazy. If anyone went through something like this and has some tips or anything that could help, please please tell me. I don't know what to do at this point, I genuinely don't know what to do anymore.",1
"Unable to overcome extreme stress severely impacting my productivity I am seriously regretting my decision to go to grad school- I thought I was prepared for it, but I'm wasn't. I was an academically strong student in my undergraduate program and went straight to grad school after because I really enjoy academia. I found my education to be so fulfilling- but now the spark is completely lost.

Ever since starting grad school my anxiety has NEVER been worse. I have always struggled, but not like this. I have panic attacks just from opening up my computer to do work. The thought of opening my email makes my chest hurt. Anxiety is showing up in other areas- I've had panic attacks because I was just convinced I was going to die within the next few days- because I just felt it. I have panic attacks when someone calls me, thinking they are going to tell me there's been some horrible tragedy. I'm convinced I see people with guns pointed toward me and I am going to be a victim of a mass shooting. I know there's something really wrong going on right now,

And I'm so depressed. I have no drive to do things. The fear of consequences is building up my anxiety, but the thought of doing the thing just seems like the most impossible feat.

I've barely submit any assignments- I keep trying to get them done. I tell myself that today is going to be the day I tackle even just one small thing, but this horrible feeling inside my chest and stomach just paralyzes me from being able to get anything done. I tell myself in 5 minutes I'll get up, it turns into 30 minutes, to 5 hours- then the next thing I know I've exhausted myself from just thinking about what I have to do &amp; I decide that I will try again tomorrow. Each time I try again, I fail.

I wish there was a way others could see how much effort I am putting in- even brushing my teeth and taking a shower are demanding tasks. Eating isn't even enjoyable &amp; food doesn't taste appealing to me- I nearly gag with every bite trying to feed myself.

I wish I didn't have to feel like this. I want to enjoy school and pursue my passions. I was so proud of how far I've come, only to let is all crash and burn now.",2

"I feel like I am running out of air and the only way to breathe is to count my calories and exercise daily, to become more pretty, I have focused for more than a year now on so primarily, how I look, I just want to look good or normal, but I do not, I feel like I look ugly and angry and if I were more fit maybe I would be attractive, but I just cannot stop, and I can isolate myself so much, and feel so stupid and weird, I just get put in a different social setting and I act weird, I can be so rude to people and I love, but I do not know if I f*cking love anyone or if anyone really cares about me. Its so easy to get comfortable in your own environment, and so I go on a trip and then talk to family/ friends or whatever and I act different or rude and I just hate myself, and I have these desires to isolate myself from my family because I do not really feel appreciated, but that is so f*cking sad, I do not want to be alone, but I do not like being around my family necessarily. But god its so funny how changing your environment can shock you and put things in perspective, maybe its a flawed perspective, maybe its good that I feel so depressed and lonely to recognize my true feelings, either way I feel really alone in my family and depressed and I do not know how to spend my time other than exercising to try to look better by losing fat and maybe I can manage that, but right now I do not know what I feel, other than extremely depressed and mean and ugly, not to be seen or spoken too, like nobody actually values talking to me, I want to be vulnerable to make this post mean something so I just want to admit that I am stubborn, and untrusting, but I really want to take any life change suggestions or advice and to make good choices so if anyone has any it would mean a lot. I think I might be depressed, I feel very emotionally overwhelmed and heavy and have no reason exactly",1

"I do not know if I have depression or not. What I do know is that feeling the absolute fucking worst about everything and everyone around me happens quite often and never truly goes away. This knowledge that my mind goes to this place so often always stays at the back of my mind and I am always acutely aware of it regardless of whatever else I am doing. I can see it in my own eyes every time I look in the mirror. Sometimes I wonder whether other people see it too, although I would guess not. Because no one checks up on me and the one person that claims to care about me is pretty shitty and inconsistent, although she is the best I have got. I lost all my friends over a year ago and I know they all still talk about me from time to time, which I am not sure if I appreciate or not. In this past year I have met a handful of people, but still feel lonely and could not identify anyone who I would actually call a close friend, nor do I delong to any kind of group of friends. In other words I am lonely. Sometimes I miss my old friends so bad and other times I am glad I do not speak to them for who they have become since then. I think this is around where my problems start but I do not know that for certain either. I am currently living in the worst stage of my life so far and I do not know if I will make it out. I am 19 and only a few years ago I had a clear view of what I wanted my life to turn out like and where it was going to go. It almost feels like all those things are happening and that I am being left behind to build my own new path brick by brick, and I am all out if bricks. My head feels like a dull, dense boring grey rock with nothing going in or out and nothing ever changing. I do not have access to weapons in my country but if I had a gun in my home, I would point it under my chin without hesitation, and seriously consider stopping this mess right there and then. I just feel like my head is a big grey rock with no individuality or sensitivity",1

I have never had a real true friend who has my back n i honestly believe at this point I have never experienced authentic relationships or friendships bc every one I have ever had has been fucked up n I am convinced I am incapable of loving/being loved loli cannot stop eating fucking shit and cannot make myself work out. I am not really in danger of engaging in harmful behaviours i would say, its just posting this type of shit on diet subs receives the wrong type of comments from ppl who do not realise i have an eating disorder I am not even sure if I am in relapse anymore or what its like i just do not give a fuck anymore but I am getting fatter and fatter and its making me more depressed, the only thing that brings me joy or comfort is food, i eat bc I am depressed i get even more depressed when i eat n gain weighti cba to talk to anyone except my friend who is ignoring me, my family text me and i ignore them its a chore to reply to them and exhausting trying to act normal and i cba to tell them about how shit everything is for me rn. it pisses me off bc my friend is studying to be some sort of mental health nurse therapist type person and literally the advice he gives me is to just help myself .... I am starting to really dislike him and resent himall i do is sit at home all day until i have to go to work on fridays saturdays and sundays, its absolutely exhausting because I am shy and quiet and introverted and work with the public in a very intimate job so I am constantly having to be fake and polite and talk to people all day about shit i literally could not care less about all i can think when I am talking to someone is how much i want to be in a quiet room rn by myself and nowhere near them. i finish one shift and I am absolutely drained mentally and physically and completely exhausted. i had a pretty traumatising experience the other week where a guy came in for a massage (i work in a spa) and he got an erection during this and was being really weird with me and inappropriate and its really grossed me out everyone pisses me off and grosses me out I am so spiteful and mean nowadays i cannot stand to be around anyone i have the shortest temper and my patience is non existent whether I am driving, at the supermarket, talking to my friend or family etcat night i cannot sleep because my mind races and I am just so upset and fed up all of the time everyone i do socially interact with i just do not even want to talk to themi have not been on medication for a number of years now which did not even work but considering contacting a doctor and asking to be put on medication bc i do this shit completely alone i do not talk to anyone about shit i do not take medication and I am just fucking sick of carrying all this bullshit on my shoulders 24/7 I am just done n sorry for swearing so much i just cba !! embarrassingly long rant lol",1

"Hypertensive at 25 &amp; fear of death Hi all! Having an HA episode today and I don't know how to cope. 

Went to my psychiatrist this morning where he took my blood pressure. He had to take it about three times- the numbers were in the 160/110 range. I was very nervous at this appt- my first time with a psychiatrist- but I've had high BP before at other doctor visits in the past month (ie i just got a CPAP machine last month- sleep doc said BP might come down with that treatment. and gyno reduced my birth control last month in an attempt to bring it down as well.) 

But today I took my BP again at CVS about 30 mins later and it was still high, so I went to urgent care. They said it was probably stress related though I can take other measures to reduce it- mostly, exercise more, lose weight, and reduce salt intake. They released me with no meds and an order to monitor it at home for white coat syndrome. 

Suddenly I'm terrified. I can make those lifestyle changes without issue. But what if they don't help? What if I go into cardiac arrest or stroke before I can lower it? Will exercise make it worse? Will I die in my sleep? Will I have to go on hypertension meds at 25? It runs in my family but this feels like a personal failing- my lifestyle and eating habits haven't helped, I'm sure. Am I fucked for life? Am I going to die young?

Im home now and just took it again; 160/90. I'm so scared. 

I have depression and GED which also don't help. I've been stressed out lately but I didn't think it was a huge problem. I feel like I'm just waiting to stroke out or go into extreme chest pain. I feel helpless. ",2

"im not even a person anymore. not sure i ever was on a work trip. got paid to sit in my hotel room all day. at night these thoughts overwhelm me. a few years ago i met somebody who changed the trajectory of my life. 

he was so beautiful. he had such a beautiful soul. he was so unlike me. i was obsessed with him. we even dated for a while. i made his life a living hell. i never treated anyone in my life as poorly and callously as i treated him. im sure if he stayed with he would've died. honestly he probably would've killed himself. he ghosted me. not a day goes by i dont think of him. i wish i could go back and fix things. and never say a word to him. i miss his face. i miss his voice. i miss his hair so much. im sure those are all long gone. as he transitioned more and more of what i fell in love with would fade away. i can't even imagine what he looks like now.

its sad. the thing i miss most about him. is the way he tasted. what kind of human answer is that. im a monster. a devil. i would kiss him for hours. until his lips were bruised. i would take the anger i have for this life out on him. i could still hear him gasping for air. i look at my hands and wonder why. 

i've been depressed my entire life. it was cruel of me to spread it to him. he was an angel. and i set him on fire to keep me warm. im a walking black hole who tried to destroy him. but he survived. he has a pretty good life now it looks like, well, from the outside anyway. but my soul won't heal. and i can't forgive myself. and he never will. he never should. 

i can't care about anything anymore. my parents loved me so much. my friends and family too. but i can't feel it. i don't deserve it anyways. there's no reason why or how someone like me could be so evil. i feel like a murderer. this isn't depression. these are just consequences. you wouldn't say a murderer serving his sentence in prison, in solitary confinement, has depression. he's inhuman. he can't feel a thing.",1

My life has taken a huge turn for the better. All though high school I was extremely depressed and when I finally got out I hoped it would be better.

The guy and I got into tons of fights. He was stealing from me. He lived in my apartment for free and he brought his other girlfriend over and fucker her on my couch. I only found out when I decided to get Instagram again and found his profile and that said he was dating someone else and she told me she went to his place and they had sex on his couch. I found her lip gloss in my couch a month after I threw him the hell out. I was livid. After hun and I broke up I got even more depressed I spent a whole week in my bed crying. I ended up downloading whisper and when guys started hitting on me I did not stop them. Eventually I stupidly went to one guys place because I was lonely. I told him I was dtf but not anal. Of course he gets me a red solo cup of wine and when I am only nursing it he starts pressuring me to drink more telling me I can stay the night. I did not finish the cup but I did drink more after that. Then he starts giving me edibles. I got to the point where I was almost completely out of it. He tied me up and fucked my ass. I then proceeded to just into yet another toxic as hell relationship with an guy who was married and told me he was in an open relationship (but of course never let me actually meet his wife). That was a disaster. Hes getting a divorce now. (Allegedly having nothing to do with me but do we really believe that folks?) I got a new job and my boss started sexually harassing me. Literally invited me to an orgy. He also like to hit his dab pen in the office and I got a bad habit of joining him. That never got worse than that tho because this is when I started to see the light at the end of the tunnel. My boyfriend and I started dating shortly after I got that job. Hes the most amazing man I have ever met. He cares for me. Really cares. He loves me and I love him. I got another serving job again and stayed there for about 6 months before finally getting into an office job.Now I am happier than I have ever been. My job is great for me and has helped my mental health a ton. My bf and I have been together 10 months and are going strong. I just want to put out there that no matter how bad life seems it can get better. Thank you for reading my story. TLDR: my life sucked now my life does not suck. I am glad I never committed suicide.,1

"I am honestly fucking struggling. I have some bearable days where my overthinking is not obsessive, but I just do not know what to do anymore. I am on 5mg of Zyprexa, 80mg of Prozac 20mg of Propranolol daily and recently started 10mg of Buspirone 2x a day. Also 1mg of Klonopin &amp; 20mg of Adderall as needed. I have been hospitalized 3 times. (Inpatient psych) first for psychosis, had been severely stressed out and not sleeping due to an overwhelming job position, so I was paranoid amongst other things. This first experience was less than traumatic than my last, well get to that part eventually because I clearly have a lot to unpack. I spent about two weeks inpatient at a nice college unit where I rested and recovered from my one time episode. I went home and was very depressed and suicidal considering they had just taken me off of the Effexor I was on for a few months. I was paranoid and worried that my ex was out to get me and for some reason related a TV series to my own personal life, and brought up some trauma that I previously did not unpack but made the mistake of doing it in an unsafe judgemental space. I broke up with him because I could not stand my feelings and I still fucking miss him to this day I went back in on the 31st of October of 2018. I felt unsafe and had my dad take me to the hospital. There I was at the same college inpatient unit for another 3 weeks where I had made some friends and started feeling ok. After that I went to a partial hospital program which was 5x a week morning to noon for a good 6 weeks. During that time I tried Zoloft which did not do shit apparently, then moved on to Prozac and Wellbutrin, was briefly on Risperidone my first hospitalization which made me lactate causing me to freak out which I clearly did not need at the time. After my second hospitalization I tried Abilify, went to the partial hospital program again, found a new therapist so on and so fourth. My third hospitalization started June 2020, I was tazed in my bathtub where I had went to hide when 4 police cars showed up because my father could not contain me. I had not slept in 3 days and was paranoid, handcuffed and held down by 3 police officers, and had my legs shackled. They sedated me when I got to the hospital and all I remember is trying to stretch my legs and being unable to because of the foot cuffs. I felt helpless and humiliated, I had no pants on and my entire building was outside when this was happening. Some asshole neighbor of mine even took a video of the whole fucking fiasco but denies it to this day. I still have a lot of trauma to unpack and have struggled with finding a therapist. I have had a few and i just do not get shit through my thick head. I am fucking blabbering but I am desperate and leaving to my parents country tomorrow to get clean off weed because all I do is smoke to escape my feelings. I am suicidal as fuck and live for the life and love of my parents and sister. I am desperate for any insight thought or anything.

"The girl in question is my best friend and I am one of hers (not speculation, she is told me that before). Yesterday we went out with our entire group of friends, had a little too much to drink and someone straight up asked if there was any attraction between members of the group. When it came to her she listed the male members of the group (like we asked her to) and she just bluntly named the guys she would like to sleep with and the 2 she really would not. Par for the course of my entire life she named me in the second group. I laughed it off but I am honestly devastated, not surprised mind you since only one girl has ever fancied me and that was over a decade ago. I must admit that before all of this happened I had a tiny sliver of hope she might fancy me since we get along incredibly well.Now before any of you think of calling her a bitch, she really is not. All of us slightly pressured her to answer the question and I personally told her to be honest about it.&amp;#x200B;Thanks for reading, even if it is only one or two of you.

Does anyone else suffer from dental anxiety? How have you cured it? I'm not talking about a fear of dentists.  (Though I have that too) what I'm talking about is the fear of having something wrong with your teath. Worrying about every speck or black spot that I see.  Checking my gums constantly to make sure that they are ok.  I spend so much time in front of a mirror and a light checking to make sure there are no new signs of any dental issues.  This is on top of brushing my teeth after everytime I eat (usually). It's getting so stressful for me. To the point where I dont really have the energy to do things that I want to do or hobbies.  How the heck do I get this under control? Does anyone else suffer from this.  I think part of my fear is that A) I've had bad experiences in the past with dentists/dental work. B) I've started taking care of my teeth now but I'm worried old problems will show up. C) I don't have the finances for something to go wrong with my teeth. I save as much as I can but I don't make all that much so yeah.,2

"i have pretty much forgot all the good memories and cant make good memories anymore i don't know where to start but the thing is I have forgot everything good about my past, I realised this when I went to my school few days ago, where I studied for like 8 long years, I thought I would feel very nostalgic about it obviously because I have spent 8 whole years there with my friends, had a lot of fun, but right when I step into my school, I can't remember a single freaking thing and even if i would I gave almost no reaction at all, I didn't even smiled and that's making me sad.

Another Situation Like The Above :

I have got a girlfriend recently its been like 5 months and we meet in person twice or thrice in a month, and I met her yesterday too, when I am with her I pretty much enjoy everything, the feeling of hugging her, kissing her, and just doing stupid things together, but as soon as I drop her home its like all the memories just fade away, right after I drop her home I forget the feeling of huggin her, kissing her. I usually took this for granted all the time but yesterday after dropping her at her home tears started coming out of my eyes because of how much I hated this. I actually don't have anyone to talk about this with neither can I go to a therapist or whatever, can anyone please please please help me a little bit. 
I will appreciate it a lot.

In short its just like when I am doing something I will enjoy it and be present in that particular situation but as soon as I leave I am gonna forget everything about it. 

So if anyone knows what's going on with me please help.",3

"It has become nearly impossible for me to relate to the normal things that orher people have and take for granted everyday.

I am almost 29 now and I have never been in a real relationship in my life. People have always treated me differently. I watched as the years went by and everyone else in my family found a partner and got married. While other people found love I was here alone and I still am. This entire situation has had a terrible impact on my mental state. These days all I find myself doing is wasting the road at it my limited time and sleeping. When everyone else talks about their interests and hobbies all I can think of is oh that is nice, I wish I could afford to go out and do fun things. But since I do not have any money I can only have hobbies that are free such as writing and reading. It saddens me to no end how other people are held above us and used as a form of social capital. Its unreal how much those in power have completely ruined the natural interactions that humans used to have. Almost every single way that people interact these days is twisted and unnatural. Humans were never meant to live this way, but for some reason we continue to, day after day, much to our own dismay. Sometimes I feel this world is nothing but a nightmare when I think about the past and how people used to act. People were not always this way, but they act like there is no other alternative or other ways to live. All of these things going on within society and the interactions between us have caused my heart to become harder over the years. I used to be a sensitive person who felt a range of emotions and I used to be able to get excited about things. Now I feel like a broken person, I do not feel much anymore except extreme despair and sadness which eventually feels like nothing after a while. It is great how everyone else gets to continue to live their lives and experience all these things that people take for granted, while my life declines and gets worse everyday.

"I’m a depressed mother who is debating on leaving her family. To make this short and to the point. I’ve had depression/anxiety my whole life. It’s nothing new other than with age it seems to just get worse. I’ve been through the system for help and here I am again. 
I have a 15 month old who would be better off without her depressed mother around. My whole family is effected by my moods. It’s not fair to anyone and I definitely don’t want to be the reason everyone is walking on eggshells. I grew up like that and it’s not fun and look at me…I have problems. 
I believe it’s better for me to disappear than subject my family to this terrible illness. I’ve read how having a depressed mother can effect a child. I also know first thing. I stress my husband out like no other. It can all be solved if I just leave. My husband asks where to? I don’t know, I have no one so probably the streets. Obviously he’s not ok with it but again better than subjecting everyone to this bs. It seems like a fair trade for a better life for them and I’m put out of my misery. It’s already hard enough to live with this crap to add more guilt and shame it just doesn’t make sense.",1
"There are a number of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) techniques that I have found helpful for myself including Spielmans 3-P model, which helps explain depression and anxiety. It says that there are 3 main factors that come together to create a chronic illness (like depression or anxiety disorders). The first is predisposing factors. Predisposing factors are things like genetics or cultural/family attitudes and they are generally out of our control. Predisposing factors increase our chance of developing the symptoms of a chronic issue (if the other two factors are also present). The next is precipitating factors (or triggers) which lead to the manifestation of the symptoms (in your case maybe the panic attack at 13). Precipitating factors are usually traumatic experiences. In order for the illness to become chronic, there generally needs to be perpetuating factors as well. Perpetuating factors are thoughts or behaviors which often initially arose to help you cope with the symptoms, but now are causing the issue to continue. Behavioral activation is a specific type of CBT for depression that helps you identify what your perpetuating behaviors may be and take concrete steps to stop engaging in those behaviors. An example of one of my own perpetuating factors for depression was isolating myself/not leaving the house. In many cases this urge to isolate arose out of mental fatigue or to avoid anxiety provoking situations. But in the long run, too much isolation worsened my depression because I ended up cutting myself off from the people, activities, and outside information (outside of my own brain) that helped me regulate my emotions and feel more pleasure/joy. Changing a perpetuating behavior once you have identified it takes patience and coping skills. Coping skills help you cope with the uncomfortable emotions that come up in a way that does not perpetuate the problem. It was hard for me to get myself to do the therapy (especially in the beginning) but I can tell it has really rewired my brain in a way that makes life feel more pleasant. I am sorry about your suffering and I hope you find a way to feel better soon. CBT principles that I have found helpful",1

Lightheaded ness

Feeling of feeling balance

Insomnia
Or super deep sleep where I wake up feeling exhausted
Feeling “outside” myself
Feeling shaky and weak

"possible somniphobia? lately ive been terrified of going to sleep. i dread it all day. my anxiety has always been worse at night, and it would disrupt my sleep quite a bit occasionally, but recently ive been staying up till 2-4am every night. no matter how tired i am, i force myself to stay awake. i dont know why im so afraid of falling asleep now, i used to love sleeping and looked forward to it. its always made me a bit uneasy thinking about how vulnerable and defenseless you are while sleeping, but its never been this bad. 

im always convinced that something bad will happen to me or my pets while im sleeping, or that i'll go to sleep and not wake up in the morning (which not too long ago i would've been completely fine with). i havent had a good nights sleep in almost 2 months now. im so exhausted. it feels like i find something new to worry about almost every day, and those anxious thoughts are always the loudest at night.

"Neck Tension Hi all. I've been dealing with neck/shoulder tension for years. I am a software developer with likely bad posture - for over 10 years. Lately I'm quite stressed as well. All in all I'm in a constant state of neck/shoulder tension.

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried so many things but nothing ""releases"" it. I have one of those shoulder massagers from Amazon - it actually feels quite good especially when it rolls up my neck - but I feel like I can do it **forever** and there is just infinite tension there - shouldn't it ""stop"" at some point? I've seen some threads on here but looking to make my own I guess.

&amp;#x200B;

Things I tried:

* PT
* Chiro
* Neck/Shoulder Massager
* Stretches
* Heat pads (these actually help a little but I don't think I should be walking around every day with heat pads..maybe I can?)
* Magnesium Oil
* Like 6 different pillows - none of them result in me waking up without a stiff neck. Down pillows, thin, thick, memory foam, nothing!
* Foam roller
* Theracane/tennis balls

Has anyone found anything that actually works, and fast?",3
"This post is pretty much me trying to put abstract thoughts into words, so this may not make much sense or be in a logical order.I cannot make any sense of my thoughts or emotions. For as long as I can remember my general mood has been following a set pattern, where for a few months my emotions would generaly be happier and the next few months sader. It would not be an extreme difference, but noticeable at night while trying to sleep. Since I started high-school (2019) every few ""cycles"" there is a period of about a month where I feel sader than a normal ""sad period"". I originally attributed this to the increased stress and left it at that. But midway though the great year that was 2020 I began having a small, very faint feeling that I just did not want to exist anymore. This was during a particularly bad ""sad period"". This would because alarm bells to ring in anyone, but I knew I would not act on these thoughts due to my life philosophy. My general approach to life is to impact other people's lives positively, and to try and limit any/all negative impact. Now here is the main problem with everything. I will not tell anyone like my parents I have had any form of suicidal thoughts, because that would because them pain, and if I did act on it, then they would feel like they failed and should have done more. It would because them guilt that they did not see anything before. I just do not want to risk them being hurt. For that same reason I cannot risk hurting them if I act. So I cannot do anything.Now I have just left my current period of sad, so I feel I have the ability to prosses my thoughts a bit more rationally. This period felt worse, and for about a week I could not draw my attention away from the feeling.But I might not be REALLY suicidal (like I said, bad order) because almost every time I imagined or dreamed myself jumping off a building there was always someone else there, trying to talk me out of it. This is what confuses me, and why I cannot tell if I am really depressed/suicidal or this is just some twisted attempt my subconscious is devising to draw peoples attention to me.I would never attempt anything currently, I do not want to hurt anyone around me. But I am just worried if the current trend continues I do not know what I might do.Because I have no idea if I am blowing nothing out of proportion I have not told anyone. I will not drag anyone else into my issues. Councilors would tell my parents due to the potential severity.So to summarize, I might be depressed yet cannot act on it, or I could be not and just attention seeking. I do not know if putting my thoughts here is also me just attention seeking. I just do not know.Can anyone relate to or prosses these thoughts better than I can?Am I mentally ok? I cannot make any sense of my thoughts or emotions",1

"it is a terrible idea for one diagnose oneself, or anyone else, with any kind of mental illness.But what do you do when you see someone exhibiting patterns that share many similiarities of a particular condition?In my opinion,My dad is an extremely high-functioning autist.My mother has abandonment issues manifested through codependency and overprotectiveness.My older brother developed a plethora of rituals, that haunt him day by day. Cleanliness addiction to the point of circumcising late, and then developing a trauma from it.My sister has an oppositional defiant disorder, but last night, her entire defense mechanisms broke down from alcohol poisoning, to a point where she was attempting to drown herself.I have had two full-blown manic attacks, both of which ended with a baker act (law enforcement committed me to mental health institutions), and one of them ended in a suicide attempt, to which I simply cannot rationalize how the loaded, cocked, and safety-off gun did not fire. I do not want to rationalize it either.we are a family of Puertoricans.If anyone here knows how latino families work, parents disable their children, by doing everything *for* them, with the genuine intention of protection.I am 24 now, I am still watching my high highs, and my low lows, but as life kept rapid-firing responsabilities, and difficult obstacles to develop my craft/career, it is been a little hard to reflect upon everything.Ever since Covid started/2nd manic attack, I have been forcing myself out of my antisocial tendencies, and at the very least, have conversed extensively with my mother.My mother, coming from a small, family infested town of San Lorenzo, was always very knowledgeable of our genealogy. From her side, and from my dad's side, who also grew up in the same town.Her memory, understanding, and reasoning of our family, and quite distant ancestry, has been key to our slow, but gradual recovery.We have genes from generations of undiagnosed conditions.I want to emphasize just how important my family's hometown is to the story.Everybody knew what everybody was doing in Puerto Rico, more so in the small, rural town of San Lorenzo.it is a humid, hot tropical island with the consistent blessing of constant breeze, thanks to all the mountains.This meant that *everybody*was outside at all times.Specifically in my hometown, everyone knew each other's first and last names, their families, profession, interests... But what everyone was always in a high-alert lookout for was... what people were fucked in the head.Social class was absolutely paramount, and equivalent to success in the 20th century. But in San Lorenzo... your entire life was determined by your the image of your status. Even more so than the status itself.Who your friends could be, what jobs would become accessible, the way people would look at you, and even how your family spoke to you.Gossip spread faster than wildfire.My ancestors suffered traumas from the military. And whether or not they were willing, or even begging, to seek professional help, such weakness would tarnish the image of our name.After I loaded, cocked, and pulled the trigger on my head...That was rock-bottom.Nothing is worse than nothing.I have set myself to make ammends, and rebuild my broken family.It is tough. I am 24. I have dreams and aspirations to use my animations and break into the gaming industry.One way or another.However, the story I want to tell through my games can only written once I understand my own.I love my family.More than anything. They are the reason I am here. They are the drive behind my actions. But they are just as busy trying to find purpose in their own lives, as they are trying to rationalize their difficulties.I am content with this fate. I am happy to be here, to be alive, to know everything I know, and attempt to leave footprint of unconditional love wherever I go.But I do not have anyone to talk to.I do not want to talk about my family issues, or my mental state...But about the games they play. About books they have read.About shows they love.About their top 100 artists.About that bitch customer who just refused to leave without their change.About strategies to overcome my fear of lizards.About day-dreaming of pulling a popshuvit, even though I am terrified of falling from just walking.About how the fuck do analog clocks even work?it is all I really need, man.

It felt like that dream made me remember how it felt to not be depressed as a kid. I felt a happiness I have not felt in 10yrs.Maybe I just need therapy after all.

"Hi!First, I am very sorry for the errors, english is not my first language and I do not have the energy to read an correct :(So a little background, I am a master student in electrical engineering, I completed my bachlor degree with honors last semester. I do not love electrical engineering but I am not bad at it and I enjoy learning so I wanted to persue a master degree. I am an international student and I live far from my family which I love!!I have always been kind of pessimistic, a friend even told me that I enjoy being sad because I only read books about racism, wars and injustice. Essays that try to explain them and stuff like that. I hardly ever watch feel good movies because I do not see the point of them.I have not seen my family since december 2019 because of travel restrictions and how badly covid is handled in my country, I am not sure I will be able to visit them this summer or even during chrismas. My studies have also been a million times harder with zoom-university due to isolation and the courses being already pretty hard.&amp;#x200B;Anyway here is the core of the problem : since maybe 5 months I cry with no reason, I feel super overwhelmed without any particular reason. it is the end of the world when I have to send even the simplest mail. Last week I was either crying or sleeping. I do not want to do anything and even if I wanted I don""t have the physical ability to do so. Today for example I motivated myself to get out of bed at midday (miserable I know), I took my laptop and all I had to do was take the bus to the university. I could not do that and I just laid on the first bench I saw and slept there...This is obviously affecting my research, I want to tell my supervisor the issues I am facing but I am scared that everybody is tired and sad because of the pandemic and I am just being over-dramatic. I saw a psychologist march 2020 that told me after 20min that I had depression and anxiety but I did not like her nor did I trust what she said.Sooooo I guess my question is, do you think I should see a doctor for this and talk to my supervisor or life's supposed to be this hard? Am I depressed or just not doing enough?",1

Right now, I feel as if my mental capacity for social interaction and overall thinking has deteriorated so much that I am worried of how I will be in college. I want to have a free, independent, and enjoyable life in college, but I am not sure if I am mentally ready for that. I cannot consult a therapist for financial reasons and backlash from my parents, so what is my best course of action for me? I do not know if I am emotionally ready to go to college, and I am so scared about it",1

"I (20NB) have been growing out my hair for 6 months now and I really liked it long, although because it was curly hair Id have a ton of problems maintaining it. Despite this I was pretty happy with my hair, I really enjoyed having it long and wished to keep it that way. I decided to go to a new salon that was advertised to see if I could get a specific style because prior to this I had not had one. I showed the hair stylist a reference photo and they said that it could be done through a permanent hair styling treatment, I was skeptical but she sounded really convinced that she could do it. I decided to do the treatment for 4 hours and started to become doubtful midway through, however I trusted the process and thought my hair stylist knew what she was doing (after all, I thought she was a professional at the time). She ended up ruining my hair, and it was nothing like I wanted, she insisted that with a haircut it would be fixed and it ended up looking even worse. I found out afterwards that the treatment was very costly despite the initial price she had told me. I hate myself for not thinking before agreeing and now I have terrible hair. I am considering just cutting it all off and starting over, waiting for my hair to grow back. I am just extremely depressed about it because I really wanted to impress my friends and classmates with hair that I loved, but now I have to start from the beginning, hating the way I look.I am sorry if this is a jumbled mess, I had already been suffering from depression and was starting to feel better but this just feels like a huge block in the road.

ok, so Me(24M) have been with my gf(25F) for a little over three years. We have had a very very difficult relationship! Recently have found out that she has BPD! We have had problems with being “intimate” with each other for majority of the relationship! She had given birth to her kid just a few months before we got together, so I figured it was post partom.

However, it will be 4 years soon since she’s had him so I’m not understanding as much now as to why it’s such an issue to want me!

She always tells me it’s not me and it’s just her head, but as a person who has A LOT of mental disorders I just can’t seem to believe her! So now she gets diagnosed with BPD, and I’m wondering if this would have an effect on her sex drive also! I also have BPD but I still have a sex drive… It’s getting to the point that I want to leave the relationship, cause I’m not getting what I need! I have a  VERY high sex drive and she was told about this when we started dating! I love her with everything in me and would love to spend the rest of my life with her and our child.

"I have stopped taking my anti-depressants. They made me completely numb and I never felt any emotion at all while I was on them. Since I stopped, all the emotions of the past started flooding back and now I do realise why I started taking them in the first place. I am feeling all these negative emotions again and I started to see the world very negatively too. Everything bad that happens to me, even if it is out of anybody's control, I take it personally. For example when somebody accidentally bumps into me, they do it because they hate me and think I am ugly. When I drop a pen or whatever, it is because I am useless and I cannot do anything right. Every small thing hurts me way too much. I have been trying to talk to my bf about it. But he struggles mentally too and somehow he always finds a way to turn the tables around and make me comfort him even when I need it the most at that time. I tell him how bad I feel and he apologises for being a bad bf because he could not keep me happy. that is not true at all he is not a bad bf because he could not keep me happy and it hurts me that he thinks so. I have one other friend I do trust enough to tell but I feel like I will be a bother to her. I did tell her a few times and she did listen and even helped me calm down but I do not want to bother her too much. My mom and brother do not understand me at all, my brother makes fun of me and my scars and threatens to beat me so badly that I will have to go to the hospital and my mom just does not understand which makes her frustrated and makes her yell at me. I feel like everybody is walking over me. it is a chaos in my mind and I cannot get the peace back. But I also do not want to feel like a robot again. I do not want to go back on anti-depressants.This was just a rant I just needed to get it off my chest Feeling lonely and nobody listens",1
"I do not know when I became this person. I do not recognize myself at all. I do not know where the old me went. I just want to be happy again, and I am trying my hardest to do so. I do not know how I became some who was so cold hearted and does not care for anyone. I have not gone one day without smoking weed, its my only way to feel happy. Now that smoking has became a problem I have no outlet. I have no way of making myself happy, because any other things that do make me happy are out of the question. I am the problem in everyone is life, and even they have said so. I do not know how I got to the point where I do not eat anymore. I hardly care about my appearance, or about anything in general. I do not know why I have not committed suicide yet. I am so unhappy with my life and anything I do, does not make it better. I am trying emotionally and physically to try and be happy, to try and do things to make myself happy, they only temporarily last. Ill only ever be temporarily happy, and then its gone. I do not know how to change, I have tried everything I could. I am more outgoing, I push myself outside of my comfort square, and yet it does not work. I do not know who I am anymore. I am someone who no one recognizes, I am someone who I hardly recognize. One way or another I know I am ever going to get better, and I probably will have to end up committing suicide. Its not like I actually want to die, I just do not want to have to live like this anymore. I do not even recognize myself anymore",1
"this post might be kind of vent-y and a ramble but I will start by saying that i understand depression. i have bipolar ii and struggle as well, but with medication and therapy i manage it. my girlfriend, however, has been battling depression for years and has some days where she barely gets out of bed. she cries a lot and i can tell she is stressed and in pain but i do not know what i can do. she is iffy about going to therapy and she does take lexapro, but i sometimes wonder if that makes her feel more tired as a side effect. she told me she feels like she does not have the energy to get better. i love her so much and i just want to help as much as i can without her feeling guilty about it. i know that i cannot fix everything, but i would like to make life a bit easier on her. we are going to move in together soon and i think that could create more opportunities for me to help out. if anyone has any suggestions i would appreciate hearing them! what can i do for my depressed gf?",1

"I do not even know where to start I have had/ have a screwed up life, anything bad that can happen does. I have been depressed since I had my daughter and it gets worse and worse. My family has nothing to do with me basically but a select few and the people I do have our not supportive to me with my mental health. I know I am screwed up but I have no insurance or money to pay to get help from a professional when I get down or alone I just need family there to help but most time they just get mad at me and say this again or ruining another time or even I cannot do this anymore. My daughter who is just a child is the only support system I have and I cannot talk to her about anything. I do not know what to do my family says I ruin there lifes because way I am but I do not know how to fix me. I try to hide how I am feeling from family but then it builds up and I explode and its worse but if I show it then its bad to I really do not know what to do or where to go. I do not have any friends I have people I call friends but but they people I talk to once every few months. How can I do this when I do not have anyone in my corner no one that is patient enough to deal with me. I get some my family have mental stuff to but on their bad days I am right there with them supporting helping them through no matter what.

"Well, I've been on an anti-depressant now, and I definitely feel less depressed and motivated but my anxiety has gotten slightly worse. I explained all my symptoms to the dr I saw today and expressed my concerns to her about taking benzos every day (family history of addiction and I find myself to have a very obsessive personality.) and she totally agreed with me and said I probably have GAD along with the depression. She added an anti-seizure med as a mood stabilizer and told me that should hopefully level out how I am feeling and take care of the anxiety that is probably being brought on by the anti-depressant. I am so happy that a dr actually listened to me.",0

"i had some bloodwork this week &amp; last, and now i got my period - is it normal to feel like this, or should i do something? hi, so last week i had some blood taken for a test. and then this past tuesday i had some taken - this one was rough, i almost passed out &amp; threw up. afterwards i felt so gross and tingly and weak. well, i got my period last night. and today i’m back to feeling this tingly weak way - my friend said it’s because they took so much blood and that i’m on my period (which i always have a very heavy flow) and also ik anemic so that doesn’t help lmao.

but yeah no i feel very shaky and my feet are tingling and are going numb, my hands are tingling, and i’m just exhausted. i was at work earlier and jokingly asked my friend to check my pulse and she said it actually felt faster than a normal pulse. 

is this normal? does it make sense? i called my dr just to be safe and they took what i said out of context and went on a tangent and gave a spiel about periods and how i should visit with an OBGYN (which i’m doing at the end of the month) i just absolutely hate this feeling of tingly and weak and exhausted. is there anything i can do to make it better? or is it just a waiting game?",2

"Long story shot last Thursday I had a panic attack because I let myself get drowned be the fear of dying and I saw myself ceasing to exist and never being here again. It was so awful I ended up with a lot of consequences:1.- Vivid Hallucinations of everyone dying, even actors on TV2.- Constant fear of dying and experiencing death3.- Everything around me is a reminder of death 4.- Fear of seeing TV (actors will die), listening music (singers are death), social media (old profile pictures of people are a reminder they are now closer to death), fear of spending time.I have started going to therapy, antidepressants and anxiolytics.Before that event I used to enjoy my days, found meaning in everything, was ready to face death, worked hard in myself and in my job. I too have friends and a gf. However recently I cannot find meaning in anything, I am just performing actions when I can, without any glimpse of enthusiasm. My head resorts to you are going to die and everyone else also, there is no point.I looked myself in the mirror and my mind told me in a couple of years there is going to be no reflection, you will not exist.And while I am constantly being bombarded by this and feeling down I am also thinking that I do not want to keep on this life if I have to see my loved ones go, one by one.

"I have been diagnosed with depression before, tried antidepressants, saw a therapist regularly for years. There were times I was skeptical but most of the time I knew I was depressed. Now I am not certain. When I am alone, I can get really down and wish I ceased to exist.

But there are moments that I feel really happy, alive, excited. I laugh so gleefully at the animal posts on Reddit. I get really into good movies. My positive mood surprises me because how could I have been thinking I feel like I am doing loved ones a favor by staying alive because I really do not care to live one minute and then be thinking I am so happy that animals are so cute the next. This confuses me because I thought I am really in a funk and may need to find some help, but maybe its just in certain situations that I feel like that and I can still find joy in life.Its been extremely difficult to find a good therapist. It was difficult before when I could have in person sessions but I do not know how to even relate or open up to someone remotely. So I have not been trying.. Is this depression?",1
They did not even know he had cancer two weeks ago and now he only as a week at most. What the fuck? Covid fucked him up pretty bad and they thought that was all that was wrong with him for a year. Which they were constantly monitoring him to get him back to normal from Covid. How did they not find out he was in stage 4 leukemia and brain cancer during at that testing. Insurance is not covering a ton of the testing and treatment of what they thought was covid so his wife is like 100k plus in debt for the medical care even before he got admitted for cancer and I do not have the money to help. A bunch of family hate each other so I am one of the only ones to go see him. I am just so fucking sad everything sucks so bad right now. A family member of mine is dying of brain cancer and I do not know if hell be conscious for me to say goodbye by the time I get across the country to see him for the last time.,1

"I dislike my mother so much I believe it has crossed to hate. I hate she gave birth to me. I hate how I look. I see her features in my reflection, and I breakdown crying. I do not want to look like her. My friends say I look better than her. I am beautiful. I am a good person. I care about others and think about the perspective of others. My mother only thinks about herself, does not care about hearing me talk about anyone else that does not affect her. She hated the idea of me volunteering that I kept it hidden. I never told her all the volunteering I did at school and after. I know she is not a good person. My close friend even suggested I should change my name or middle name all together. I am a cis female who goes by a different female name because I can hear her voice when I hear my name. My mother tried to raise me with advice, but she never raised me. All the help I should have had, the eating habits, eating veggies, not sweets, see doctors, see specialists, social skills, everything a parent should do for their child she did not. She could have kids, so she did. She has issues that my friend told me I need to learn how to work with kids because she is like one. She lived in outdated times and would refuse to listen to change. She may have loved my birth father, but come to ask anything about him, she has no clue. This man is who she chose to have as a father? She does not know anything about him. My friend says she has trauma from all her life. Why did she give birth? It is likely nobody would like her, so she created friends. I am older. I can change a lot, but a lot is too late. The damage is done. I am likely to kill myself at some point because as I progress in life with changes I can make, I have to deal with the permanent damage that affects my quality of life. The sad part is if we had universal healthcare, I could try and fix some of the damage. I see her reflection",1

"I think I had mentioned previously that, I was married. I have been married to a wonderful woman for nearly 37 years and, our love life WAS amazing. Key word WAS. She is never interested in the physical part anymore. She says she has vaginal issues and, I have absolutely no reason to disbelieve her. We tease each other now and then but, the act never happens. I take ""Men's Romance"" supplements and they help to a certain extent but, only for me to be able to masturbate to internet porn. That usually handles one need but, it is not the same as the act. It is a very wonderful thing to lay naked and, in the arms of someone you love. Especially after a mind blowing orgasm. We have not made love in a VERY long time and, I miss that. Even once in awhile would be nice. But, it never happens. I want her to want me to make love! She says she still finds me attractive but, it never happens. Always a reason. I do not doubt that, her reasons are legitimate and God knows, she is not cheating. I miss that intimacy. I need that intimacy. I have to have that intimacy!! I do not cheat, I cannot. That is not me. But, my fantasies are off the chart and, they are mostly about her!! But, I know it does not matter because, it is not going to happen. Hence the depression. Not a NEW reason per say but, a reason nevertheless. I am tired of jerking off. But, I would sooner swallow Drain cleaner than go looking elsewhere for the physical part. So, here I sit. Sucking it up and, moving onto the next depression. SIGH! Hope all is well for you all. Love and, hugs. Another Day, another new reason to be depressed.",1

"I don’t know if people normally feel this way I try to care about people, but I really don’t and I don’t understand why I can’t. Like, I’ve never actually felt bad for anyone but obviously I still act like I do and I realized that most people usually care. Like if they were gone, I wouldn’t care, and if they got injured or anything, I’d just shrug it off instead of worrying. When something happens to me, most people show sympathy and it just makes me think if they’re being genuine. Maybe it’s because I’m not good with emotions? Or..idk I’m emotionally unavailable? Does thinking this way make me a bad person?

"what are the early symptoms of Colon cancer? (23 yrs old) (worried so much) My stomach has been having some problem for a month now, it started from a sharp sting pain in my upper middle abdomen I was checked for a possible of ulcer but turned out negative and took some ultrasound but everything is normal, I was given a Omeprazole and some antacid syrup (Aluminium hydroxide dried gel, Magnesium hydroxide) and it worked. I changed my diet, but after some time my upper left side of my abdomen begins to hurt every time I finished my food and it will go away if I release a gas or burp but moving to this week I feel suddenly feel a discomfort in my stomach ( I feel that it is filled with air) and every time I release a gas its turns ok then after a half an hour it will the discomfort will begin again. I started to search for some symptoms relating to what I'm experiencing and it kind of leads me to colon cancer though I'm not sure how to examine myself on bloody stool, and I haven't experience vomit nor nausea.  


All the test was done on a clinic, I really want to do an endoscopy to make sure so I suggested to my parents to have it checked in a hospital since we have insurance even if we live in a different country but they told me to wait and have it checked in a hospital during my vacation to our home country which is 1st week of March but I can't wait that much because of the symptoms and its giving me some worries ",2

"2+ years of relentless HIV anxiety - please read and KEEP CALM For the last couple of years, I have been utterly petrified of HIV. I'd say it has crossed my mind at least once an hour for the last 2 years and 4 months. Statistically, the chances of me having it were  alwaysridiculously small, and none of the science would support the hypothesis that I had contracted HIV.

But some brains work in funny ways. And mine is an example of a brain that immediately believes the worst possible outcome. And I'm sure there are many many many more out there who have wrapped themselves in a similar web of self-loathing and utter panic. The advent of Dr Google is good, but it can also do some terrible things for our mental health.

The solution the whole time was simple: test. Test and set yourself free. It's hugely important on so many levels to know your HIV status. For your own health, for your sexual partner's health. For the sake of the NHS. I am so glad I got tested. I can literally feel a part of my brain resuming activity. It feels strange not carrying around the fear I had been carrying before; it has literally given me a headache as my brain tries to decide how to reallocate this space.

I had ALL the symptoms. Absolutely text book seroconversion illness. Fever, sore throat, swollen glands, night sweats, stomach discomfort, everything. Doctor's presumed it was glandular fever, but tests never confirmed the presence of the EBV (which it should for glandular fever). Classic ARS. Of course, after a couple of weeks I was back on my feet again, and the doctor was quite content.Then about a year after this, I came out in a weird rash that wouldn't go away for like 2 weeks. Seemed like some sort of bacterial infection (to me). And it always got worse in the sun. OBVIOUSLY my immune system was compromised.

From the moment of my ""glandular fever"" my brain had convinced myself I was carrying HIV. But I wasn't brave enough to test. I was being cowardly. However, over the last few months I've been having some stomach issues, which are pretty non-specific, and the internet didn't really help me link it to HIV. The doctor did suggest a CBC test for me though, I think just to get an idea if anything was going on, blood-wise (obviously lol). I was told by the nurse who carried out the blood test that it was very much a case of ""no news is good news"".

Of course, having had the blood test on Monday, first thing on Tuesday I got a call from the doctor. My white blood cell count was low, and she wanted me to come in so she could feel my lymph nodes. AHHHHH! My brain went in to overdrive. I couldn't cope. This was it. My worst fears realised. Why me? Why me?!! That's exactly what HIV does - it attacks white blood cells. Nooooo!

I went in for the doctor's appointment, and she said all my lymph nodes were normally and no cause for concern.

She did then say, ""I would like to test you for HIV"". My world was crumbling inwards. I couldn't believe that this was happening to me, a very conservative, early twentys, heterosexual male. I looked at the statistics to such a deep level, that I knew that in my country of residence, there was only 32 males aged 15-24 who were HIV positive. That's essentially like 0% of the population. I was about to become a medical phenomenon.

The doctor eventually decided just to take the CBC again in 6 weeks time, and that we wouldn't test for HIV just yet (as I kind of freaked out when she suggested the HIV test). But the time was now - I needed to know. I would have no quality of life with this intense level of anxiety coursing through every fibre of my being, every second of the day. I had a second job interview for a pretty plush job that day, and I totally flunked it due to the unbearable mental tension I felt.

I did manage to summon the courage to order a HIV home test kit, which I had delivered to my family home, where I would have the test in the presence of my family so that I could receive immediate support from those closest to me when the test returned a positive result (and in my head, it was very much of WHEN not IF). I spoke to them on the day the doctor said about my low WBC, and they were all wonderfully supportive (did have to speak to my Mum about my sex-life though - not ideal).

So I went home yesterday, and I had the test. And, of course, it was a big fat NEGATIVE. Which it always has been. It was a crucifying 15 minutes waiting for the test to work, but during those 15 minutes, on a deep level I felt a sense of peace. The band aid had been ripped off, and life was going to move on.

HIV is the worst for health anxiety, as almost everything can be linked back to it. The anxiety can make your brain question everything - I was even questioning my ability to swallow at one point. But the chances are, going off the plethora of statistics out there, you don't have it, whoever you are who is out there searching for every piece of HIV research ever (which has been me for the last two years). But still, if the anxiety is as stressful and overbearing as what I was experiencing, you need to get tested. Now. Somehow. Make it happen.

I took the time to write this in the hope that someone who is currently going through a similar thing to what I went through, can find solace in it. You will be alright regardless. You are a good person. But you need to put your mind to rest. You need to have the test. 

'Thinking Fast and Slow' by Daniel Kahneman teaches a brilliant lesson in terms of this. Our brains are desperate to come up with a story that will justify our irrational way of thinking/catastrophising. But numbers matter. Statistics speak volumes. You are not special. You are overwhelmingly likely to be normal. You aren't the 1 in 100,000 shot. You are the 99,999 out of 100,000 shot. Our brains struggle to compute the true values of these numbers, but we must try. 

Peace!

My city has been in shambles and under attack because of looting and violence, buildings have been burnt to the ground and now that things are a bit quiet they want to rebuild. The residents would patrol everyday and night, taking turns but they issued a statement that they have done their job and they will not be patrolling anymore which makes me anxious and afraid, I feel as if they are letting their guard down way too early :( those looters want to come destroy our homes and lives too. I do not have a good feeling about this, how can anyone feels safe after this? This life is already unbearable, I do not feel good being alive anymore there is nothing for me here.. I want to leave bed for I suffer more.. its scary, I cannot explain this to people. I feel sick to my stomach. Its only a matter of time before they get us.

"I was on depression medication bc I was having chest pains at random times. they did the full screening of my body to make sure it was not physically and everything was good. I started them and they were like okay? like it just kind of made me motivated than anything. sexual side effects got to me so now I am only on anxiety, which stops the chest pain but i still get anxious so like, I guess it stopped the terrible chest pain but like I am still anxious, which I guess is normal. I feel like its impossible to be in a relationship when I am like this. I broke up with my girlfriend for a few months like a year ago and I truly felt so good for awhile. maybe even she is weighing on me? Anyways any tips anyone has on how they beat their depression battles? my depression is not like self harm but sometimes think what would happen if I just wrecked my car (even though I never intentionally would), just some bad thoughts that I would not act on, no motivation, distance myself from everyone. for years I hated how skinny I was and when me and my gf broke up I put on some muscle and now I am getting a stomach I absolutely hate seeing, which then I do not put any consistent time into working out which does not help my mind either. I went on a few vacations and that was good to be out of this shitty area. mixed 21 year old in a republican/ racist ass area. like literally seen n word killer and drive by a truck with a black stay back sticker every single day. I am also absolutely terrible about talking about anything. I need out of this but idk how. I feel like last time I got like this I just broke up with my girlfriend and do not want to do that again. i work full time but literally do next to nothing all week which probably is not good for me in any way either. like where does this motivation come from? I want to actually be able to get out and stay out of this headspace. I am like genuinely ever happy just playing PlayStation with my friends/ talking to my friends on there. its the only time I am ever myself (and with gf). its like a big ass disconnect from everything and lifes actually hood.

"Hey, everyone. First off, I will start by saying that this is my first post here, so do please let me know if I have broken any rules with it.Secondly, to give some context (and to also let off some steam), I am pretty sure I have been depressed one way or another for a very long time now. I have never been diagnosed by-the-book, but every therapist I have seen so far has pretty much let me know that it is there. From what I have read and discussed with them, my best guess is that I have something related to dysthymia, although I would say I am generally pretty functional - it is like having an autopilot which allows me to go through the daily routine while being miserable and hopeless (there is no official diagnosis because the therapists I have seen do not like applying labels and have not considered it severe enough to recommend a psychiatric evaluation).I occasionally get an episode which is worse than the norm. I mostly always feel a sense of generalised hopelessness and sadness, but the episodes feel like I am thrown down a bottomless pit of despair. I am currently going through one of these episodes as a result of recently having done a sum-up of my life during the past few years.My problem right now, and the reason why I post this here, is that I feel that my support group, my few close friends to whom I have only relatively recently started opening up about this, have started trying to persuade me that my depression's incorrect, somehow. I have been thinking pretty much all day that maybe I am just too sensitive at this particular point in time and maybe I am reading too much into it, but I keep feeling minimised and invalidated when talking to them (stuff like ""you have an incorrect view of yourself,"" ""you are being overly-dramatic,"" ""I am sure things are not as bad as you see them,"" ""maybe you have some form of dissociative disorder"" - this last one came straight out of left field, since all of the therapists I have seen so far have, at one point or another, remarked my fervent insistence on keeping facts and reality as straight as I possibly could). All of these just... hurt, especially knowing my history of deep-diving into my thoughts and realising that most points which because me my unrest are conclusions drawn according to objectively negative and damaging experiences from throughout my life.do not get me wrong, I know depression does not really allow for objective perspectives, even less so during an intense episode, but everything they say just makes me feel like they are not even trying to take it seriously, even for a second.they are currently insisting that I join them for a group call to discuss ""magical realism"" (an attempt at a joke, I assume), but I really do not feel like that kind of invalidation and minimisation's what I need right now. My question, thus, is how do I deal with this? Am I taking things too personally, is this entire thing just another element of my episode? If not, how could I politely explain this to them without them having a knee-jerk reaction? I am honestly reticent to broach the subject because I expect they will lean even harder onto that ""incorrect perception"" of mine and I really do not want to upset them more than I clearly am doing with my episode. Hard enough to open up about it in the first place... Thank you for taking the time to read through all of that, and thank you in advance for any advice you could offer. In need of advice for dealing with minimising friends",1

My biggest regret As the days go on the more I think about everything that’s happened in the past years I can honestly say that I regret being so weak I absolutely despise the moment in my life when I let my feelings take over telling myself it was okay to cry when shit got tough telling myself it was okay to shut down for a little this world has shown me that it’ll never stops kicking you even when your down and having to learn how to be strong again has been a journey trying to better myself hasn’t been easy and I know that as life goes on it won’t get any easier,1
"I am in my early years of high school. I feel fucking horrible just thinking about how nothing happens. it is not like I do not have friends it is that my friend group just does not try to do anything outside of computer games. I do play a lot of computer games myself but I just cannot fucking take not going out. since my friends do not do shit I try to make shit work with other people in different groups and it kind of works but not to a degree where I can go out with them and have a good time. The number of holidays and breaks I have spent rotting away in my room doing absolutely nothing, staring at a screen for 12 hours makes me sadder and sadder but this is all I can do. I often look at others Snapchat or insta stories and see them having a fucking blast and it hits me that I am so alone in my room. I do not want to ask anybody else to go out with me because I am scared that ill look desperate. The only reason I want to go out is that I want to take my mind off school. I do not do bad at school but I do not necessarily do well either. I am just a mediocre student. Every time I come back home with a passing grade without trying my parents lovingly say ""you are smart but you just do not try. We know you can do it"" and it demoralises me to realise that I want things to change but I do not make it happen. It leaves me believing that my parents deserve a better son. Every time I feel sad, I feel guilty for being sad even though I have a loving family and a great group of friends. I am sorry if this is just hormone-filled teen talk but i just though I would write this out I do not even think I should be sad",1
"Health anxiety - germs worry Tonight I met with a friend that I haven’t seen in a long time. We had a great time, had a few beers and chatted loads. 

We then decided to have a cigarette. Yes I know it’s bad but it’s been a while since we had one and we were having a good time so went ahead with it. I accidentally dropped mine on the street and proceeded to pick it up and smoked it anyway. It’s probably a few seconds after dropping and the pavement is on a relatively quiet area but still in a public areas. 

I didn’t think much of it but after a few hours I’m sitting here worried. I am afraid that I might’ve caught something from smoking the cigarette dropped on the pavement. I’ve always been a bit germaphobe so this is making my thoughts worse. I can’t sleep … 

Anyone here ever tried smoking a cigarette dropped on the floor? 

Sorry for the rant…. Just can’t stopped worrying.",2

"Really worried about my kidneys. Any advice? I'm a 20 year old male, 5'7"", 130lbs. I got blood work done and it found my Ferritin to be high at 328 ug/L and B12 high at 658 pmol/L and high LDL cholesterol at 3.39 mmol/L. My eGFR is 88 with Creatinine at 105 umol/L and magnesium at 0.99 mmol/L. My urine came back negative for protein, blood and nitrite. A week later I had Ferritin tested again and it was 427ug/L.  I also had an abdominal ultrasound which showed regular kidneys but a 3mm ployp was found on my gallbladder. It sound be noted that all the test I've done thus far has not been for my kidneys but a pain in my abdomen which I'm seeing a GI specialist for. Should I though look into my kidneys? As these findings from what I've read may seem normal for an older person but not a 20 year old. Also would working out hard just over 24hr before the test affect the results? Or a meat heavy diet dispite a 12hr fast? Thanks 

Also my grandma had polycystic kidney disease but from my understanding it was not the heredarity type.",2

"Help only works for those who help themselves. I think I am just not cut out for the life. I think I had enough. I am just inherently incapable of doing anything in life. I want to sleep forever. Sleep is the only thing that does not hurt. Except that every second of being hurts. I always try to fight it back and remain optimistic. But I think this is the time. This is the feeling. it is a signal from Universe to me, this feeling. That I am a mistake and I deserve nothing. Because I just cannot put efforts in anything now. I feel ashamed that I do not even have courage to end my life. Maybe this is my fate to just suffer. Suffer endlessly without any ability to stop this suffering.

"Trembling when talking about things I’m around, and don’t scare me after having bad experience with weed edibles This might be a long post so sorry about that but I just want to have all the details. Back in December my now ex girlfriend gave me 2 weed edible gummies that were around a year old (I think) I’m not entirely sure if this is true or not but I think they were each about 50 mg when brand new. This was the first time I’ve done any drugs or anything like that not even weed but I wanted them from her and accepted them with a smile on my face being excited to do them. I then get home and eat them both at once and I’m feeling pretty awesome and happy but can’t really focus on anything and I’m laughing a lot and smiling at everything while on a FaceTime call with some friends. Then I start noticing my heart was beating incredibly fast and strong (at least I think it was) I thought the left side of my chest would explode and started freaking out about that. I ended up freaking out and having a almost full on panic attack and thought I was going to die and forced myself to throw up, then laid in the shower for about 2 hours on the coldest setting not realizing I was shivering and shaking like crazy the entire time I then force myself to sleep and wake up thinking I’m dead and feeling like shit for the next week or so and had weird pains in my chest. I then cut off almost all contact with the girlfriend (thinking back I shouldn’t have done this and I do feel bad I was just so shaken up because of that experience) fast forward to now I am around lots of talk about drugs I always have but about 3 weeks ago when I was going to smoke my fiends cart for the first time, just talking about it gave me these tremors and I was shaking until I calmed down about 10 minutes later but I was talking to him with a smile on my face wanting to hit his cart I wasn’t scared at all I just got these shakes, these jitters in my legs I don’t even understand why their happening when I’m actually in front of or about to do drugs that don’t even scare me just on Wednesday I was going to buy some weed (regular flower) from my other friend and I got the same trembles just texting him and had to play it off with the people next to me saying I’m cold.

I start crying then my boyfriend just thinks here we go again.. He tries. But nothing helps except sleep and time. I am not motivated at all. I have no interests. I just scroll through social media. No desire for sex. And I know he deserves better. But he says he loves me. But another girl could treat him better. Be happy all the time. Want sex all the time. Not shut down and wish she was dead. I stress him out. I know it. I am just pathetic. Feeling so alone when you know people love you.",1

"Scared of brain amoeba Exactly one year ago I was in New Zealand where they have these geothermal pools which have a brain eating amoeba in them, which is why you shouldn't inhale that water. I didn't go into one of those but I did go into a normal hot tub and scraped my knee doing so. And I sat there for a minute before realising that it was actually bleeding so I went up and cleaned the wound and put a band aid on. Then I sat back in but didn't put my knee back in. Lately I have been freaking out over this because I have been thinking a lot about health related things. I have heard that if you do get infected you will notice the symptoms really quickly but since it's been a year I should be in the clear, right?",2

"Cold water immersion for stress relief I’m currently on day 12 of getting in ice water for 15 minutes/day. And I have to say it’s the most powerful stress reliever I’ve come across. I meditate minimum 30 minutes a day but nothing compares to cold water.

I sleep like a baby and for the rest of the day feel calm and in control. 

I don’t plan on stopping anytime soon the benefits seem to far outweigh my being uncomfortable for the time in the water",3

Sadly that does not mean that everybody else love me and care about me as well I had people using me and having fun with me, without me noticing it from may school years I never had a loyal friend or even somebody to talk with because people thing I am a weirdo now I am 18years old and I have trouble of communication I do not show my feelings to anyone near me because I know that there are worse problems in this world such as not having to eat etc. so I am not important at all I also had dreams for my life until my family came and destroyed my hopes of achieving them. I always wanted to join the police academy but my family threatened me that if I enter this academy they will kick me out from home because I will be a fucking pig dressed in a blue uniform Inside my house I had many fights and I was usually a spectator of them almost every day until my 15 I had fights with a small reduction of them between my 13-15. I was locked in my room most of the times so I can at least make my ears stop from listening by putting some music and trying to hide my pain inside me ( fights was between my parents and my sisters but also between my parents ) In most of the times I just sit on my bed thinking and crying about my mistakes and usually convincing my self that I am not worthy and useful to anything and I achieved that as well I have not seen a good dream since 3 months and I wake up most of the times with a very fast heart beat I am feeling that I am not a human being than a monster because I do not do what other people do ( like watching football like every men does or like being able to fix something when it broken etc.)I usually have anger under minor things and I am always blaming my self for it because I am a useless monster. I also feel very stressed when I have to talk with someone ( and think that I am working as a check-in agent ) and I am trying to be as kind as possible so I can hide my stress not only in my working area but generallyIm not addicted to alcohol or drugs or anything so that is the only positive for meI used to like reading about history specially at the WWII era and I used to love trap music now I am just seating on my bed most of the time trying to find music that people love so I can have a reason to connect with them and I am scrolling for memes just to find something to laugh and cheer me up a bit I do not know why am I still alive and how am I still in this world when the world do not want meDisclaimer: sorry for my bad English its not my native language ( I cannot even do that as well ) and sorry for this long post I just really wanted to write it somewhere because I am having a breakdown like every night I do not know how am I still alive",1

"Being born mortal is worse than not having been born in the first place. My mortality recently hit me for real, and it's been sending me into a deep depression. Everything feels utterly pointless, because no matter how well I live, I'll die and not remember any of it. There won't be any legacy of me, since the universe itself will die in the end. Nothing has any point to it, we're just here to plug our ears and pretend that we're never going to die, despite also being certain of it. My whole life just fell apart, and now I can barely enjoy things knowing it'll all be gone. I keep mourning my friends and family, knowing everything I do with them amounts to nothing. No professional help or medication can change these things. Existence is just a prison where they dangle all these wonderful things in front of you, and then remind you that you'll be dead and none of it will have mattered. There's no afterlife, no legacy, nothing. This feels like the cruelest joke imaginable. I have zero motivation to pursue a career, knowing it's all for nothing. I can barely enjoy my hobbies, knowing they're just a distraction and won't be remembered by anyone.",1

I went through the entirety of secondary school chasing people and trying to be involved.I am now sitting here with no friends at all. The same people that I were chasing still try to fuck me over for the fun of it and each time I fall for it in the hope that they actually like me. No matter how many times I block them, they will find a way to talk to me, they will apologise and then go right back to fucking me over.I keep having urges to try and drown myself in the sink or try to overdose on all of the medication that I have in my house. If you are currently in a similar situation, get out now. I let it happen and I am fucking miserable. My fake friends gave me false hope for 5 years and now I have suicidal thoughts.",1

"I used to be extremely hypersexual, but it was frustrating because I was not getting any. Citalopram massively reduced by libido and made it impossible to orgasm, but I did not mind this change at first. At one point I was taking 40mg, which is the highest allowable dose.After tapering off, my sexual function never fully returned and I kind of miss it. it is been over a year now. I was on the drugs for a few years.Prior to antidepressants, even at the age of 27, I would get random erections. I would sometimes get so aroused I would HAVE to masturbate or I would be agitated and could not think about anything else. Not to get too graphic, but I used to get a lot of pre-cum, and when I ejaculated I would squirt quite far, often over my head, and it would be A LOT of volume. It was easy to reach orgasm, and when I did they were intense.Now, the end of my dick is dry and lacks sensitivity. it is really hard to reach orgasm and I am significantly less aroused in the first place. I miss the thrill of trying not to cum prematurely. Now I cannot cum without vigorous stimulation and it does not even feel good. Did your libido never fully recover after quitting antidepressants?",1

"tw: death""Existential dread"" I have heard the phrase thrown around a lot but did not really know what it means. I think it was triggered after my grandpa died, and my mom turning 50, and being left alone with my thoughts during the summer. I do not know how to cope with it, but I have tried to stay out of my room. I only go in there to sleep - and I have been waking up at 4 AM every day to sit in the car for hours. Then I will take midol and fall asleep at 8 PM. I stopped showering as often, stopped eating. I eat breakfast and that is it. I have tried to stay hydrated at least. I am currently working on creative projects (a web series, lots of writing), and it provides a distraction. But I have nothing to do after that. I recently met up with a childhood friend and even when we talked I felt myself feeling depressed 'why am I even here right now nothing matters' idk. I tried clinging to religion but even that does not help me. I find myself worrying about running out of time. I am 21, and just started my first year of college. I feel like a lot of people meet their soulmates when they are 18-21 and are ready to get married after a while. I do not know what I want in life. I am increasingly worried about my mom, 50 is half your life.. The thought of only having her for 20/30 years or so hurts. does not seem like enough time you know? Sometimes I would rather die than have to experience the people around me dying. Does anyone know how to cope with this? Or is anyone else dealing with this type of stuff?

"Thinking back, my life was always disaster. I lost my dad when I was young, being raise up by mom who struggled with terrible depression and anxiety and her own abusive mother, constantly thinking what the hell I am doing in this world. I remember thinking that I will give anything for my life being just slightly better - not fine, not in order, just a little light in the dark. Years passed and I am in much better point that I ever was - I managed to step back from most of my shitty family, managed to have some career (it is really nothing at all but it is something to keep me far away from poverty and that is really more than enough), even have a girlfriend which is weird because I hate intimacy (actually I am pretty sure I am asexual but that is another thing) but she is has its own problems and we somehow could balance everything and move on. I think? Looks pretty good? Well, maybe. Thing is, I am a black hole, big fucking black hole that is just sucking up everything positive that is coming to me and turn it into vapor. Back in my ""horrible"" days I could cry, scream and put some video game or series on and managed to put my brain into escape-mode. I cannot do that anymore. Nothing, nothing in the slightest gives me joy, everything that comes from mouths of other people is just mumble for me, I do not fucking care about nearly anything. I care about my girlfriend but it takes 9.0 magnitude brain quake to do slightest thing and I am so tired after anything that I wish I could take a brake for this world for a month (or eternity).I was trying to convince myself that I am just in bad luck. Maybe my job is just fucking mess (and ones before that too, how convenient) etc, one day I will change it and everything will be fine. Well, nope. it is just downward spiral. I cannot find way back. I am useless, no matter what anyone think. I cannot learn anything. I cannot speak my thoughts. I cannot stop my thoughts. I cannot cry anymore. Once upon a time... I felt horrible all the time. Now I do not feel anything at all. And that is horrible",1

"Head pressure, ear wooshing, stiff neck, and headache I already wrote a message to my Doctor, so rest assured I will get appropriate medical care. But I am wondering if anyone else ever goes through this? On a daily basis, and sadly due to mental health and living with family, I am very stressed... However, I also have a hobby that is my favorite hobby but also puts a lot of pressure on me, which is competitive gaming. I wouldn't say pressure, but... Concentration and adrenaline, etc. 

Almost every day, for... a long time now, longer than I even can think of, I have really weird head pressure. It's like a headache with a stiff neck and when I realize I am holding my breath, I take a deep breath and feel like I haven't breathed all day. Lately, it's been worse. Feeling almost sick or like I'd feel after crying AND I also have ear wooshing in my right ear, whenever there is silence. 

Does anyone else have this happen or know what this might be? I tried looking up what I'm going through and cannot really find anything, especially the head pressure. It's just a feeling of ""I don't feel right."" too... I am going to try to post this on an anxiety Reddit too, to see if anyone there might have a clue as well.",3

"I am not looking for sympathy or kind words. I just need to briefly open the vent that I so frequently forget is closed.Have you ever seen one of those charity coin spiral devices? You would put a coin in, and watch as it spirals down. It would go slowly at first, then pick up speed as the circumference becomes smaller and smaller, until an audible chink, and then silence. It reminds me of a black hole - a one way journey to the centre. Well I am somewhere on that spiral, maybe not at the bottom, but far from the top, and past the event horizon from where no matter returns. I guess in a sense we are all on that spiral, but I feel much further down than I should be at this point. As I sit at home on my computer, slowly deteriorating, having been to therapy twice and both times removed from the service for missing appointments, all that was interesting or exciting is blown away by the most gentle of winds, and all that remains is an empty she will of what once was. I am, by choice, disconnected from society, and I despise the human race and the brutal foundations it so delicately rests upon. I have problems with my stomach which mean I have such little energy that everything feels like a lot of effort, and I am in pain most days. The doctors cannot find anything wrong, and I have given up trying to find an answer or a cure. I loathe everything about myself, and by everything I really do mean e v e r y t h i n g! From the way I look, to the way I interact with people, to every nuance that defines who I am - an incomprehensible number of variables. As I do not like interacting with people anymore, and having largely withdrawn from society, I have also begun to neglect my hygiene and my health. Every day feels like groundhog day - waking up and maintaining myself for nothing, just to live another day in pain, a pointless expense of energy which I can no longer afford. Many days now I eat one meal per day, and struggle to find the energy or will to have a shower and take care of myself. I am beginning to be able to describe myself as Christian Bale from 'The Machinist', but less productive - at least Christian goes to work every day and forms some type of relationships. I eat when my stomach allows me to, I sleep when I pass out from tiredness, I wake when the birds become too loud to ignore, and I leave the house when absolutely necessary. I feel sorry for anyone that I befriend, as I know I will lose interest eventually, have an episode where I do not want to talk to anyone, and will inevitably just stop talking to them altogether, so I have stopped making new friends as it is not fair on them. I infrequently talk to the one or two I still have, and make excuses often for why ""I cannot talk today"". I struggle to make long term goals as I do not see myself being here long term. When I think into the future, I see a make-believe fantasy of what could never exist, nothing even remotely tangible given reality as it is precursor, and so I prolong my existence with video games and make-believe - a distraction, a way to delay the inevitable. But as soon as I exit the video game, the day dream, the false fantasy, and remove the veil of distraction, I am thrown back into and reminded of the world in which I am expected to be happy, in which I am expected to be grateful, a world that I am expected to enjoy, but do not. Every day I see the spiral steepening, and feel my speed towards the centre increasing. I am not sure when the slope of the spiral will become to steep to maintain my spin and drop me into the darkness of the unknown, but I am slipping. A Spiral Into The Inevitable",1
"I have been depressed for months now and its starting to feel like its not just a temporary lack of chemicals or whatever. I feel shitty in a way that feels like a perfectly natural response to my life, my shortcomings, my regrets, my stupidity, my cowardess. It also feels like a normal response to how shitty, random, difficult, and scary life is. Has anybody been able to overcome this? Is it truly just my distorted view of things right now or is this something that will never get better no matter what I do? Depression or just reality?",1

Then I asked her if she was mad or sad over me and she said no so what is the problem I am trying my best I feel like I cannot breath I feel like my heart was stabbed and then stepped on I feel like I cannot do without her. She helped me through so much thing. I cannot even breathe,1

"A great, simple technique for coping with health anxiety (I posted this as a comment to another thread about panic attacks, but thought it warranted its own post. It's adapted for anxiety from a similar method in *Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy*, a book on depression by David D. Burns, M.D.)

***************

If you struggle with health anxiety (or any kind of anxiety really), give this a try the next time your worries start to get the better of you. I do it in an Excel spreadsheet, but a notebook works fine too.


**The Three-Column Technique**
 


**Column 1: Fear**
 
In this column, write down whatever's freaking you out at the moment: ""I'm worried I'll have a heart attack out of nowhere"" or ""What if someone took what I said at yesterday's meeting the wrong way?""

**Column 2: What triggered it**
 
Write down what you were thinking, feeling or doing when you started down your current worry spiral. For example, ""I felt a skipped heartbeat"" or ""I felt my lymph nodes and they seemed a little swollen."" Over time, some triggers will appear more often in your notes than others, helping you spot habits that get you into trouble.

**Column 3: Real talk**
 
Normally, you only think of the worst-case scenario. This is your chance to do the opposite: write down every reason you can think of that you'll be absolutely fine - which, by the way, are *exponentially more realistic scenarios*. Go nuts; the more you write, the better you'll feel. 

For example, my scariest symptoms are skipped heartbeats, so when I feel one, I list points like these:


 * Skipped heartbeats are perfectly normal; most people have them and don't even notice


 * Some people experience thousands of skipped beats a day and are perfectly healthy


 * You already met with a cardiologist, and she gave you a clean bill of health


 * Skipped beats are a very common side effect of anxiety - it's much more likely anxiety is the cause than some rare heart defect


 * This aside, I have zero symptoms of an underlying heart issue


  ...and on and on.

 
The more you use this technique, the more you'll notice the same fears and triggers popping up over and over again. And when you see that, you'll see how often you worry about the same thing - and how your worst fears are never, ever realized.

 
Hope this helps, stay strong!",2

"This is not a pity post or anything like that. Just an explanation, really. I do not cut to distract myself from trauma I am going through. I do not do it for this reason or that reason.To put it simply, I hate my body. I always have ever since I was a little kid I absolutely despised my body and my genetics. Cutting is self destruction on the body. So, what better way to show just how much I hate my body, than to slowly damage and destroy it? Every scar is more evidence of how disgusted I am of myself. Why I cut",1

entered my body without my wish kelly moore s dad a white kindergarten teacher in a majority chinese school felix another white men that raped me unconsciously in the club naz in which i still not entirely sure how i got lured into i look back at my self i sometimes wondered what went wrong how i wa made the best and then the worst why did i always had a bad time why i don t remember anything why and why and why did all this happened to me i think i just had an over amount of change that now i need a giant break but i don t know how to relax i love you but who i need to love someone why do

bit day by day faded into the background i guess for now i know there s more to life than romance and belonging there s knowledge and creation story line and peacefulness in nature i realised that s when i m most allowed to stay is when i realised i m not rejected by the other side i m not rejected by hell a place that ll understand me may devil protect me and be by my side got ta stop having death fantasy must be a reason why i m fortunate and not is it karma or wealth abused or wa i too spoiled to think i deserve happiness is it karma or illness it must be karma right i know everything

i need clue i need to find out if i m the other woman why do you want to know thing you shouldn t know ugliest ugliest truth still better than lie in my opinion and when i learned the fact that i am nothing in your story this is where i imagine love story that involves the girl you actually like is this process psychopathic i think it s a poetic way of practicing being a wife haven t wrote shit

"I (F16) feel like an outcast, and an unwanted one at that. All of my peers seem to be interested in different things but I cannot find anything in common with any of them, because there is nothing interesting about me (I am also socially awkward big time so that does not help). Its so difficult for me to find friends and form romantic relationships. Like I said there is nothing interesting about me, I have got no skills (a couple hobbies maybe but I am not good at them). In addition to that I am not that attractive. My meds have made it hard to manage my weight and my face is just 4/10, if I am being generous. It just feels unfair compared to all the attractive girls who attend my school. I know what people say, that its good to be different. But what if being different feels lonely? there is more to this but its 5:15 in the morning and I am tired. I feel like an outcast.",1

"So, I am a few months shy of 21, I have been struggling with depression since I was 14 and, right now, my life has gone through some drastic changes that have affected my mental health. I dropped out of college to pursue a career in medicine (I used to be a nursing student, now I am seeking medical school) and that, associated with quarantine, made me spend a lot of time home.Because of this, I have been dealing with constant homophobia by my family, especially my father and brother and more unrequested comments about everything I do. This has led my down a darker path, I have stopped studying, running (I was a marathonist), gained 20kg from anxiety eating, and I barely brush my teeth. I have gone back to self-harming pretty much every day after being clean for 4 months and have planned to take my own life on August 1st, even wrote my goodbyes to my family and my girlfriend. I want to get help, I know I am not okay and just found out my insurance covers psychiatric interventions (yayyy) but I am a bit scared to go there since I, during psych rotations in nursing school, I dealt with some pretty scary situations. I would love some insight about what it is like in there and here your thought about itThanks in advance, have a wonderful day Has anyone here ever been to a psych ward? If so, what is it like?",1

"I am depressed, but I have always been falling towards this place. I wasted time on reading excessively in early age, to playing Lol and thinking about it most of a day, to watching Youtube for 7 h everyday, to browsing reddit, youtube and watching anime. I never lived my live, I never provided value or do anything meaningful. I am lucky enough to have friends that pull me out of the house or get me into parties, but I probably never in my life went out with anyone by my own will. Depression eats me and I allow it. I fall behind my peers, I never really understood them because I do not grow and despite my attempts - I do not believe I can do it. I cannot quit and working on myself does not help because I am becoming even more depressed with how i cannot ""enjoy"" live in ways I am comfortable with. Anyone relate? I never really lived",1

"I have been walking around being productive, I have a boyfriend, I have emancipation papers (not filled out), I have this big plan on how I am going to go out and live life and pursue college. I have told all my friends that I am going to leave my family (which I feel like is emotionally and mentally abusive but I am not sure) and go get an apartment and finish highschool and go straight to college and then Med school. Problem is, I have not actually done any of that. This past year I got pulled out of school twice for suicide watch, my grades plummeted, I quit my sports team and I cut off most of my friends, I stopped showing up to work and I just tried to not to kill myself. Recently its been getting worse at home. My father has become more controlling, grounding me for stupid things, taking away my car, not letting me see my boyfriend or friends, gaslighting me for not spending time with him, etc. My mother has gotten better she has not manipulated me in a while so I think were fine. Her husband on the other hand, says that I am the reason my mothers health has deteriorated, both of my stepparents have said that I am the reason our family is dysfunctional. Sometimes I like to think I am stronger than others, that I have it worse than my friends, but that is not true at all. I am weaker than all of them. My life is so easy. So why should I want to stop existing? there is been awful shit that is happened when I was a kid Ill admit, but as of late lifes not as bad as it could be. Idk I just feel so stupid.

"it is not because I do not want my family to suffer. it is not because I want to live. it is because whenever I failed at something I was looking forward to, I found out that some other rich kid had connections with ""the company' so of course they got the scholarship instead. that is the way life is. If there is anything I learned over the last few years, is that nothing in this planet is that nothing is designed for your well being. People will fuck you the fuck up just for fun. So yeah, I want to die really bad but I am not planning to just because I was not born with the privilege of having a better life. I am letting my parents have their moment so I will live against my will until I am dead. If reading horror stories, dating chicks I barely know, and binge drinking is what makes me happy then so be it. The reason I do not kill myself is because the system is corrupted to it is core",1
"Apart from my mom and teachers.Yes. Not even ""Hello"" OR a 10 second conversation. Nothing. To me girls are more of a mythological being than something that actually exists in reality.Also I have been bullied mercilessly by everyone my whole life, zero respect when it comes to pretty much everything. Example what recently happened: I went to a hairdresser and I said I want her to cut it to medium lenght, then she proceeded to cut it almost bald and said men are supposed to have short hair. Now Imagine this kind of bullshit every single time you engage with someone in a conversation. Since I do not have anyone to talk to, I started to daydream a lot, it is called maladaptive daydreaming and I do it 15 hours everyday, depending on how much I sleep. And also I talk to myself all the time, because like I said I have nobody to talk to. But at the same time I do not want to be with anyone because I took umbrage against the whole society for treating me the way they did and I do not think it is ok for me to be accept anyone in my life even if someone wants to be my friend (Which is impossible).

A few weeks ago I lost my parents and both siblings in a car accident. The loss of my entire family has completely ruined me. To make matters worse a month before this happened my girlfriend of 3 years and I broke up and had been struggling a ton with that. I have absolutely no one. I have been in the darkest place imaginable ever since. I have barely slept since and when I do manage a couple hours I wake up with the worst nightmares and a full blown panic attack so bad I feel as if I am having a heart attack. Almost every night I have the most vivid dreams of the accident and of my family telling me how much they miss me. I cannot eat and have lost 30 lbs. I have not been able to go back to work since. I do not know how to continue with life and I do not want to. I have lost everything and my life is withering away day by day. I would not wish this on my worst enemy and remind you all to be grateful for every little thing you have everyday. I am not looking for a pity party. I just have no one to talk to. God help me.

They are extremely individualistic. My parents keep surveillance all the time. I feel like I am living in an mental institution I can do anything without my parents knowing. They take turns leaving the house so I am not alone. I cannot rely on my friends all the time. Literally just work and go home. I feel so disconnected from the world like my life is not real.

Everywhere I look on the internet or even just regular conversations people seem to be OBSESSED with height. Any short male is deemed as a joke these days and I cannot take it anymore.I do not even like standing up because I am reminded of my height. I do not look in a mirror because of how ugly and short I am. A reminder that men will always look down on me thinking they can beat me up and if I were to magically get a girlfriend, her friends and family will always remark on how she could do better.I do not see the point in continuing on. The only way a short guy like me can find some sort of happiness in this world is by being very rich. Otherwise, no matter how hard I work, no matter how social I am, Ill always be 57.

"I’ve been managing my health anxiety pretty well! .....until today So, I’m on 150mg of Zoloft daily, along with Lamictal (not certain about the dosage). Today, I was taking my daily pills but I accidentally took an extra pill, which I guess would mean I took 250mg. My mom called the pharmacist who said I should be fine but to look out for fainting. Ironically, I felt lightheaded just seconds after realizing I’d taken more than the prescribed dose. So I’m guessing that was anxiety because no pill affects you that fast (as far as I’m aware).

But, technically, it still is an overdose, but a small one. Whenever I drink water, it feels weird on my throat and there’s a tickle in my throat (though that could be a mix of allergies and anxiety). And when I got up at first I felt dizzy.

I looked it up and it says that 200mg is usually the max dosage. I took 50mg more. I’m afraid to sleep or anything. This happened around 5 hours ago. If I’d overdosed on a fatal level, would I have exhibited severe and obvious symptoms by now? I’m just so paranoid now ",2

They revealed to me they have depression. I am a bit confused because the person told me we could hang out sometime, but whenever I message them I get no response at all. My social anxiety kicked in and I cannot tell if the person just does not care about being friends, or if they are going through a rough time and messaging someone right now is too much for them. They posted themselves crying not too long ago, but my social anxiety makes me think that they just do not want to talk to me and only said we should hang out last time to appeae nice.If they constantly post to social media but will not answer messages, that definitely means they are not interested, or does that mean they may be going through a difficult time?

When the pandemic hit I was hitting the bottle a little too hard like finishing a bottle tequila every other day. I sought help from the therapists we have at work. We get 6 sessions and for whatever reason this therapist saw how broken I was and continued therapy for a whole year without mentioning our limit has long been passed. He finally did this past week. I knew it was coming and bless his heart for going above and beyond. I am completely sober but just as depressed. I cannot fathom opening up all over again. I am sinking and this time I am not even trying to save myself. My hygiene has been horrid I am glad we have lotion and perfumes to hide the worst of it. To make matters worse my so called friends decided to go out without inviting me but had the nerve to send me tons of photos of how much fun they were having. I blocked them all. Its exhausting even contemplating therapy from scratch. Its scary not having a lifeline yet its so difficult reaching out for help. Thanks for reading. Finding a therapist,1

"Can Stress Relief Help With Weight Loss? So recently been doing some research for a new blog post on my website.  It's about if better stress management can help lose weight or not.

The weekend prior to that I went to an event and had purchased a new bra, turns out it was a wee bit ill fitting and I was uncomfortable in it but didn’t think much of it.

My head is an absolute growing mess. I am dealing with SH urges creeping up again and it nags at me, It drains me fighting the feelings and thoughts. I am a few years clean from it but that does not negate the fact that at the end of the day I am a SH addict I guess and I just have to live with the urges - Its been going on for nearly a year and just worsens but I have not done it; I do not intend to but I need to talk about it and let it out so I do not just bottle it up, That makes things worse.

"I honestly wanted others opinion on this. When I was younger, I got sexually harassed by my uncle (it was not rape, he only touched/grabbed and whatever my body, but that is not important) and I have been dealing with a some kind of trauma since then. I have tried to talk about it to my surroundings (apparently it helps to move o but most of them made me feel bad about it as if they would not believe me. A friend called me stupid and naive, another one kept joking about sexual harassments and uncles, my ex step father kept telling me that I was jealous of my mom and that I wanted to sleep with him and see him naked, that I liked older men a lot. And when i told a group of close friends they nodded and acted as if I have not said anything. I was wondering if me being unattractive would be the reason why they all reacted weirdly, I mean who would believe that an uncle would take the chance to be called a pedophile just to put his hands on an ugly chick?

"Drove downwind of a confirmed asbestos fire today. freaking the hell out so yeah, there was a major fire in the city today. we had no idea till we were driving up on it. The route I wanted to take was blocked due to the fire. At that time, we had no idea the smoke was highly toxic. So cause our route was blocked, I took a street pretty much parellel to the one we were supposed to take. We drive, and we come across smoke, and drive right through it. I also played the funny guy, and breathed in really hard and said ""mmmm smell that"" to be funny.

Read on the news when we got home the building contained asbestos, and theres an asbestos warning for the whole city center. So yeah, now here we are. I'm in a really, really bad place now.

That said, there are a few things which I guess are kinda making me feel a bit better. We were about 800 feet maybe from the burning building in question, and we drove through about 8 hours after the fire started, and apparently it had been contained by that point.

Still we walked around the city center all day, and drove through it, and waited at a stop light in the smoke. My lungs feel full, and I think my nose burns a little, though that could be becuase later on, at the bar, I stood with my frie ds a few times while they all smoked cigarettes.

And this is kinda gross, but I could have sworn my farts had a kind of asphalt like smell, which I got when I quit smoking, which indicates smoke inhalation of some kind. I guess I could be misidentiying it though.

I dunno... I'm just really scared now.",2

"Does anyone else have a rotating 'portfolio' of health worries? I've had a number of scares in the past year since I've identified my health anxiety. I wouldn't call any of them explicitly painful, but there's a distracting discomfort that's hard to shake and when a panic attack happens, the discomfort is magnified a hundredfold. 

My mind tends to focus on one of them at a time : my chest, my abdominal area, my tooth filling, and my testicle. Doctors have already told me that each of these areas are fine, and I'm mostly mentally stable with that, but when my anxiety flares up it tells me that the doctors didn't do enough tests, they just brushed it off as imagined anxiety pains or IBS because I'm young and the probability of something serious is low. It's like my anxiety constantly picks at my defenses to see if it can get a footing and crawl into my brain. 

I used to be a WebMD nut that would look up every odd symptom and have panic attacks. I still get freaked out by the odd thing; that I have a brain tumor every time I misspell a word or I flub some speech, for example. But I'm mostly sticking to the ones I know nowadays. 

Does anyone else have a 'portfolio' of half-resolved worries like this? Or does your anxiety mostly conjure up new symptoms? ",2

"I (17M) have been diagnosed with Aspergers, although my experiences are better described as high functioning autism (although I do not function at all lol), a semi-official type of Autism. Luckily, my autism was recognised very early in my life, when I was about 3/4 years old. I was diagnosed with PDD-NOS (later with Aspergers). Because of my amazing parents who fought very hard for me to get the help I needed, I got special training in primary school. I not only learned how to communicate with other people, but also to control my ""explosions"", when it all got too much for me from all the information in my head I exploded (screaming, swearing, slamming with doors). I am very thankful for this and it has allowed me to be socially semi-functional and make friends. However, this training had an unintended consequence, I was convinced that the only way to be accepted in society was to isolate myself when it all got too much for me. This does not always work out, and afterwards I feel really guilty, especially if it happens around people I love, because I see it leaves an impact on them. It also does not really help that I am constantly irritated, because of the pandemic, lack of sleep and maybe depression?I feel so guilty for being such an asshole, my friends and family do not deserve it, it is also the reason I feel like I do not deserve their love. Does anyone have similar experiences and/or advice how to convince myself I am worthy of love? I would really love to hear your thoughts I feel like I do not deserve love",1

Anxiety about being a share house So I'm a pretty anxious person but when I'm out and about I can sort of just deal with it. But when I'm at home and living with strangers I find it really hard to come out of my room to just do normal things like cook if they are in the kitchen or going to the bathroom while someone is around. It's really frustrating because I feel like I just sit and fester with it in my room but I just get too anxious to leave. My home is somewhere I need to be most comfortable so I'm finding it a bit debilitating not feeling comfortable. So does anyone have some tips for me to build up the courage to just become a normal roommate. I've tried making conversation with the person I'm living with but they didn't really seem interested so I think that has made more anxious. But yeah if anyone has any help that would be greatly appreciated 😊,2

Basically the way I'm looking to another person (I try to picture myself how I might be looking and whether it's not wierd). Sometimes I record myself with a phone to see what's the oddity with my behaviour.

The reason this has developed is because from class 5-6 I realised there was something wrong... People would keep a stare once they got a glance of me. I realise, in retrospect, that's because I looked like a girl even though I'm a boy. Perhaps some hormones got messed up and I got some feminine features like long eye lashes, girly lips, girl type face, curved hip, short height.

"Brain tumor anxiety Hey reddit. I'll start by saying that I'm a huge 22 year old hypochondriac. It started in last December, when I pooped a lot of blood and I was convinced that I've got colon cancer, I couldn't function properly for a whole month before I got my colonoscopy which revealed a small benign polyp which was removed.  
 
Anyways, since yesterday all I've been reading about is brain tumors. The reason of that is, when I was in work yesterday (slept only 6 hours and didn't have breakfast, then worked from 8 am to 2 pm) I kind of tripped twice when I was standing and wanted to turn around. Like, I'm clumsy overall and I sometimes trip or bump onto things, but never so often. Also, when handing the change to the customer (I'm a student but I work part time as a cashier) I dropped a coin twice. Or when he asked me for certain cigarretes, I grabbed the blue instead of red ones etc. After the day of overall lack of concentration I started googling and I found that brain tumor may cause clumsiness, loss of concentration, balance etc. I had a CT scan done 4 years ago due to head trauma but it was clear. However, I've read that tumors can grow fast. Should I go to doctor or observe myself for couple days? I've never head headaches as well. ",2

"I do not have any friends or anything and I am so sad about it. And there was a girl talking to me, telling me that she loves me and all and it made me feel a little bit better. I wanted her to be in my life, I wanted to hug her, kiss her. I thought that she can be my safe haven, my escape from all the madness. But, long story short, she was not very loyal :) And this actually made me feel even worse. I already feel so like a subhuman and imagine, there is a girl I once loved so much and a guy can just, just fuck her if he wants to (I do not think she fucked him yet but I am not sure). Can you fucking imagine how fucking inferior I feel to him? Like, he is stepping on me, laughing at my face and.... I just, it is impossible to describe how it feels. it is awful.But she is everyone I have, I go to her whenever I am sad and want to talk about it. I do not have anyone to seek comfort in, I do not know, I mean yes I know I have to cut her out but I just cannot. I am extremely lonely and I do not know how to cut that one person out of my life",1

"First time poster, never used to be like this! Hi all,

About two years ago I passed out in my bedroom after riding home from work by bike on a cold day. Immediately jumped into a hot shower. Felt dizzy, confused, and then boom, hit the ground. Was kind of half aware half unaware, but then had a killer headache after a bit and slept it off. 

Went to the ER the next day for a CT Scan. Everything was peachy. Went about my regular day for a good 4 months until I was playing league and all of a sudden the cursor disappeared whenever it went past my right eye. I could still see out of it, but I couldn't follow the cursor. Then the text became hard to read. Then I tried texting my mom that I was having a stroke but it came out like gibbrish. Then slow creeping numbness up my left arm all the way to my face. Somehow managed to call 911 and they brought me in by ambulance. Diagnosed migraines. MRI was clean. 

All that happened two years ago. I regularly get these stroke-level migraines with aphasia and confusion about once a month. Every sinus infection is a brain infection, every unsymmetrical feature on my skull is a swollen lymph node and lymphoma. I'm itchy all the time in my apartment, so I've got liver failure. Every minor ache or pain is the worst possible disease. I can't help myself making doctor appointments because I don't believe I have migraines.

My life has been ruined, my personality completely changed. I don't even feel real, I walk around with de-realization daily. Who am I?

WTF is going on and how do I begin to deal? I'm only 29 and by most accounts pretty healthy.",2

Like we fight all the fucking time parents and I) and my parents are such a fuckin mess at times you see the type of shit you see in Hollywood movies.Opening up to people in the slightest terrifies me. Actual FEAR now. As you can tell I am not exactly well adjusted. I have some interest in maybe, three things tops. Of the three, all of them require a lot of learning to be able to even begin. Problem being I shut down in the face of trouble from past experiences of elitist assholes wanting to feel superior to others.

My sister and I were very close throughout our entire childhood and into our adulthood, but recently our relationship changed, and I do not think it will be the same again. I have a chronic illness now, and I do not work outside of the home. My husband works for us. Its even more difficult to make friends now, being sick. The pandemic made it worse. I did try chatting with new friends online, but they would forget about me after a week and would stop putting in any effort. I was always carrying the conversation.I dunno. I have become a bit of an introvert over the years. I think I am fine with what I got. I have a huge family and I have nourished those relationships quite well.

"I have been depressed for a really long time, essentially the majority of my life. In the midst of my current depressive episode I just notice how far back it actually goes and I have gotten 9 or 10 out of 16 years I have been living with this. I want to have a future, I want to have kids and a start a family when I am older, be successful, etc. I do not think I can do any of that if I am depressed at random. Every depressive episode can be triggered by even a mild inconvenience. My depression is only getting worse. Every year I lose the will to live more and more. Its been so long and I will need alot of therapy to get over it but that is the difficult part. By the time I can afford therapy I am scared it will be too late. My parents know about my problems but they ignore it. They know about the self harming, the suicidal thoughts, a rough idea of how long I have been depressed, etc and they do not believe its bad. I have asked for therapy multiple times and its been dismissed. Working a part time job that will allow me to afford therapy in college is iffy, affording therapy fresh out of college is iffy, whether or not I will ever be able to afford therapy is iffy. I see people, on tv, in books, in the news, online, even on subreddits like these, with children; and they constantly express how depressed they are and whether or not they can live for their children. I do not want that to be me. I do not want to grow up never getting the help I need and when I do someday have children, they lose their mother to suicide. Or even worse they grow up with a mother who is depression affects her ability to parent; and she ends up lashing out at her children or being incapable of taking care of them the way they need all the time.I want to try to heal in my life, and I know I cannot do it alone or even with support from loved ones. I know to heal I am going to need professional help, but I do not know if that is attainable. Healing before I can really live my life.",1

So from January 24th up to know I have fallen back into my anxious state. 

It all started when I went to the big city in January I hadn’t felt anxious in months and I love the city so didn’t expect it. When I was walking off my train all the way down to the shopping centre I felt my legs and they didn’t feel ‘normal’ not weak but not strong and I was really aware of them and felt like my legs would just fail to walk and I’d fall over. The more I walked the more I started to stress out it got to the point where I felt dizzy and a bit lightheaded cause I was panicking and BOOM it hit I’m think OMG am I going to pass out ! I started to panic and think maybe it was diabetes but I’m a slim 22 year old male with no health conditions but in the moment I was panicking it was horrible so derealised and the fear of impending doom ! And then 3 days later I imagine because my nervous system was stimulated I was at my grans putting her bins out and for no apparent reason 0-100mph panic attack my legs instantly out of nowhere felt weak ish and shaky and so didn’t my arms and I let out this big exhale and I felt off balance and kind of dizzy in my head I rushed out the house into the car and sat there for a minute and I was okay but walking from my car to the house again made it happen mildly. Fast forward to today 20th of June i am still struggling with anxiety. Not the instant panic attack weak legs. This is like a head pressure feeling kinda like I’m tilting my head. Anyway I get this when I go on walk and panic and think I’m gonna pass out or fall over and then I think it’s something serious. I am also getting. It in shops. Although I have been in 4 shops the past few days just to ivercome this feeling. The past two times I had it very mild but made it without a panic attack and rushing out. B  it because of this and headaches ( I want to say all my symptoms don’t hurt and they aren’t terrible they are 3/10  maybe 4.5/10 when panicking in terms of intensity but i still panic thinking I’m gonna fall to the ground or pass out. HOW DO I GET OVER THIS because I’m currently thinking I have a brain tumour. Basically all I want is reassurance that it’s anxiety and it’s not high blood pressure (had blood pressure check at doctors this year after walking there and it was fine) diabetes( I had general blood tests before and I didn’t have diabetes I am also a slim male 22) brain tumour ( head pressure and headaches making me think. Fairly certain I had similar dizziness years back when my anxiety was at my peak and my doctor kept telling me no brain tumour about 3 years ago. Also I’m scared of having low iron but I guess I just eat more iron and I’ll be okay ? Please let me know what you think. I have had 6 heart tests from three years ago up until now and it’s fine!

Thank you in advance

I am also starting to feel my heart rate again to check it and it’s stressing me out and making me more aware of it!

Also need to mention I play computer games for like 4 hours a day and not that far from my monitor lol. Could be this ? I am also on my phone a lot",2

I don’t enjoy hanging out with family or friends, I’d rather be alone but when I’m alone and at home I feel useless and depressed. I’m too tired to even explain in detail but I’m sure you all know this feeling.

"Intestinal anxiety I'm a 27 year old male, I don't smoke in any capacity nor do I do any drugs or drink alcoholic drinks in any capacity. I'm not on any medications and have no pre existing illnesses.

Last year I had a pretty large bowel movement, large enough that I couldn't pass it without manipulating my anus with my hand to ease the log out, since then I've been having blood in my stools (on toilet paper and in/on feces), the blood is red, not sure if it's dark red but it's definitely not black. I have no pain associated with passing a stool at all which is slightly comforting I guess...

Shortly after the blood started showing up last year I took myself to the ER and explained what was happening, after getting a finger up my ass I was told it was most likely hemorrhoids. Not to long after visiting the ER the blood in my stool disappeared and I was relieved, now after roughly a year ish later it's shown up again and been off and on for about a month, still no pain associated with having bowel movements, just anxiety.

For the record I have no loss of appetite, no weight loss, and no fatigue out of the ordinary. I have no direct family with a history of colorectal cancer.",2

"Seems once the antidepressant builds up in my system it just makes my productivity worse. Before meds I would have bad days and good days with most days being a mix but on meds it just seems to dull the highs and the lows and I am just in a consistently low state. All I would have to do in the past is wait for the depressive period to pass but now I just feel so out if it. I went from things having little satisfaction to them nearly having none, it made me cut some bad habits but I have no motivation for anything now. I lost interest in music, video games, social media and more. On meds I just lay in bed and maybe watch a movie at best to pass the time waiting for the depressive period to pass but on the meds it never actually does pass. it is obvious I have some form of imbalance but the meds have such a profound effect on me and change me on such a fundamental level. They change some things for the better and others for the worse but ultimately it is just different, not better. I have tried sertaline, fluoxetine, venlafaxine. I am assuming raising Sert is making my dopamine drop making my apathy worse. Curious if anyone else has experienced this. Feeling worse on medication",1

"Can't stop obsessing.. Any tips? Sorry if this is a little long, but I'm new here and desperately looking for some advice. Plus it kinda helps to get it all off my chest.. 

I've been struggling with health anxiety for a little while now, and although I keep kidding myself that I'm in control, I don't feel very in control. I can't stop the constant worrying and obsessing.

It all started just over a year ago, when I spent a week in hospital. I'm not going to go into detail as to why, as I don't want to trigger anyone else's anxiety... But it wasn't a great week.

Since then, I've been fine. I have ibs, which is unfortunate as the symptoms I get seem to really trigger my anxiety. But that's the most serious problem I have. A few other minor things, asthma, skin problems, but nothing unmanageable.

I noticed my anxiety levels shifting around a year on from my hospital stay. Think it must have just been on my mind, then I had a really bad ibs flare up that threw me. Was off my food, had no energy and lots of other unpleasant things.

Ibs is more under control now, but my anxiety is not. I feel anxious in general, have quite a foggy head alot of the time, don't really feel like myself, don't want to do much, getting tired out easy, feel like crying alot. But mostly I'm struggling because I can't stop obsessing about every little thing wrong with me.

The slightest cramp or ache sends me spiraling into a panic. I can't stop googling things to find out if there is something wrong with me. Even though I don't really have any ongoing symptoms and they are more one offs. Can't stop poking and prodding looking for lumps or enlarged lymph nodes.

Any time I find the tiniest little lump (found one or two in the fat layer on my stomach) I obsess. Can't seem to stop looking for it to see if I can find it again. Most of the time I can't, any if I find anything it's tiny so logically I know it's nothing to worry about. But I just can't stop.

It really feels like it's taking over. I just feel like I'm stuck in an endless obsessive cycle of prodding, being hyper aware of every tiny sensation, looking for things wrong with me a constantly googling.

It's got to the point that when I have a nice symptom free day, I find myself looking for something that's wrong with me as I feel like i can't trust that I'm actually ok.

Anyone got any advice, or been in a similar situation? This isn't something I find easy to open up about, but I'm scared it's going to completely consume me if I don't do something. ",2

"Dog went into heart failure over a holiday weekend. No vet could take her. Had to find an emergency clinic. They told me 200 dollars just to fill out 20 minutes of paperwork before the dog is even seen.

She died 5 minutes after getting off the phone.Could have taken her to the emergency vet the night before but I thought her cough occasional cough was from the dryness of the desert. Thought it was not that bad since she was acting like herself, even eating and drinking, otherwise. The next morning i woke up she was gagging and choking clinging to life. The rest was the end.Feel immensely guilty that I may have saved her. I am poor, broke, and cannot even afford to get my remaining dog another companion. All dogs of her size now cost between 3000-5000 and that is two to three months rent I do not have. I cannot get a shelter dog due to my apartment's rules, they have to pass a vet check and extensive behavioral opinion. of the vet. cannot bring home a dog with a questionable background/separation anxiety due to how strict they are. They review and approve everything...Matter of fact I cannot even get a dog from a breeder because my complex needs a full vet exam follower by a 3 business day decision to allow the dog. Most breeders bring a puppy litter for a basic check which is not enough, then you are responsible for the full vet check once in your possession.I feel so depressed because my remaining dog clings to me and will not leave my side.

"What helped me after 27 years? I have nevr been to this group because it would have made things worse but I am here now.
I had the worst panic attack of my life at 54. Ambulance - hospital - I knew I was having a heart attack. I couldnt feel my arms - heart racing - gave me nitro - 
I run marathons - eat well, take care of myself. I have not run in 2 months because my heart rate going up was freaking me out.
I have been to been to psychiatrist - emd helped but came back.  I have always resisted drugs because the thought of taking medicine made me more anxious.
Cut back to hospital - gave me xanax - I calmed down. EKG - Blood Work - Chest x-ray - nothing wrong go home.
Doctor gave me 10 Xanax just in case - woke up the next day anxious - took a pill (I hate drugs and for years wouldn't even consider it)  
I felt amazing all day - never had any anxious thoughts. Took another yesterday morning - same thing - all day no thoughts at all.  That is my best 2 days in 27 years - I felt normal.  It does make me sleepy and I see my psychiatrist  for the first time in 2 years tonight and I am going to ask what my best med treatment is.  I dont like the habit forming nature of Xanax but I will discuss it
Try the drugs - they work!

And it's progressively been happening more and more often, and it tends to get more severe each time. Now I have reached a point where the depression doesn't even bother me anymore I don't have the urge to fight off the negativity it all feels normal, like I'm meant to feel this way regardless of what I do. My anxiety often fights off the urges to di, fear of nothing happening after death, the question of is it better to be alive and suffer or die and be nothing, you know the usual..

It took me so much fucking effort to get to this point, forcing myself to go in spite of being so incredibly sad and tired all the fucking time and just wanting to sleep all day. I ran more regularly than I was able to fucking do laundry and now I have to break that habit in order to recover. Sure I feel sad and disgusting now since I am not able to really run but mostly it was the one good habit I was actually able to form and keep for any length of time.

"Super Nervous! So I have health anxiety, but that’s mostly due to the fact that I’ve had a bunch of scary health stuff happen this year. I almost ODed three times (I’m clean now), I got compartment syndrome in my hand and almost had to have it amputated, I had not one but TWO miscarriages, and I found out that I had a small cyst on my uterus...oh and my uterus is tilted. 

So recently I’ve been getting UTIs (I’ve always gotten like 2 per year since I was about 18). I try everything to avoid them. But I went in the other day to get it checked out and the test came back negative. So they think something might be wrong structurally. I’m so nervous that I have PID or ovarian cancer. I keep checking my symptoms. I called out of work because the pain was so bad. And my anxiety is through the roof. My SO keeps getting annoyed with me because I keep googling potential reasons for this. I know it’s not all in my head. I just don’t know how to make other people take my seriously.",2

"Broken bones, concussion. He broke my glasses in half, destroyed my TV and dvd player. He tore my clothes off but luckily didn't rape me.

"I have read so many peoples experience on Reddit with depression and it always makes me feel whole again. Like oh that is it! This person was just lacking self esteem! that is my problem too, If I study the six pillars Ill be back to normal. So I do and for a day or two I feel great. But the cycle always seems to start again. I am not even sure if its depression, but I sure feel different these days. I am 18 and when I was sixteen I felt so on top of everything, even looking back at texts I was smart funny, clever and arrogant . I had hobbies and never avoided people. Now I am isolated and anxious around friends and coworkers. Constantly thinking how to say things, what tone to use, is this an appropriate answer to this persons question and incredibly frustrated at my lack of real connection with anybody. Even my cognitive function I feel has gotten weaker, like a bon fire that has simmered down To a candle light. I started blaming the isolation with my family and now I think it was marijuana use. I hate going to my retail job, my mind blanks so often in conversation and worst of all my boss is a nice to me for the wrong reasons. He thinks I have a learning disability. My questions s where do I get help? And does anyone think I needs medication, I am fighting my dad because he does not think I need any meds and that I just have low self esteem? I think hes right about the self esteem , but maybe there is more problems like adhd or depression? Confused and frustrated needed to rant.",1

"Starting to really hate myself Im really mad at myself and get anger issues I keep inside of me… I feel like going on a rampage, go absolutely insane..
Main reason is because usually when I mess things up with a girl for being too shy or nervous… I could really go fucking crazy and I can’t fix it… I overthink situations with girls too much so I hesitate and miss my chance. Right after that I just wanna rage!!!

"Today I got divorced. Yay! Great news, right? I should be celebrating and jumping with happiness because that is what I have been wanting for the past 2 years But it turned out to be the exact opposite I have been seeing a guy since Oct 2020 Right after I broke up with my ex-husband, I started seeing him. We were just fuck buddies and eventually I caught the feelings. For a long time, I seriously thought that he wanted to be with me and the only thing holding him back was me still being married to his friend. But throughout the 9 months we have been together it has not been all great. It has had its ups and downs. I have been rejected sex many times and he always made it seem like I am the problem. Sadly, this has made my depression way worse, and I tried to commit suicide. He always brought up comments about his previous sex life being the best and well me not so great. Yippie Yet I tried to improve. I lost some weight, I tried being a better person, I tried giving better blow jobs, and I tried to ride him better. Our sex life, well for me was great in the beginning, but now its not that great. He does not want to touch me. He just wants blowjobs and me to ride him. That is it no kissing, no foreplay, no eating me out, and no other positions. So lately it has gotten boring. I am sure I can have more fun with my toys by myself. Anyways since I have caught these feelings for him, I am having a harder time letting go of him I want this attention and I still want to have sex with him even though its plain. Today since I got divorced, I thought things were going to change. I thought he was going to want to take me out to celebrate and later tonight have great sex and he does not have to feel guilty about having sex with his friends married wife. He said it used to bother him a lot. But that did not happen at all. He got home and he just wanted a blowjob I said no I got mad and he got mad. After 20 minutes after I calmed down, I tried explaining to him why I got mad. I told him I wanted him to let me know that he wanted me instead of me feeling like I am the one that is always initiating it I just want to feel wanted. But he said that I could have just sat on it I tried to make things better since I had already fucked up, but he already got mad because I said no to his blowjob and now he does not want to kiss me or have make-up sex and that I ruined his mood. Guess I ruined the whole night I shaved all smooth just for him I guess it was dumb of me to think me being divorced would want him to want me more and possibly love me. Stupid of me. Anyways because of this whole ordeal I honestly thought about cutting more. Its dumb because I already cut up my arm bad 7 big cuts and the scars will not fade. So, I am trying to not cut at all. Anyways I do not know what to do. I am afraid of losing him forever. I love him I do not know if I should just pretend that I do not care about him anymore and just stop asking for sex I wish I loved myself enough to walk away because all that I am doing is hurting myself for loving him. He makes me feel like my pussy is gross. That I am too fat. Too emotional have too much baggage. If I am crying, he just sits there on his phone he does not even try to talk to me. He says I am just being a big dumb cry baby. Guess I need someone who understand my depression and mood swings. Someone who will appreciate my love. Guess I fall for the wrong guys, right? Maybe I need a girlfriend. Thanks for reading typing out this has made me stop crying and the feeling to cut myself has gone away. I know what many of you are going to say you are dumb and stupid for loving him and staying in that relationship. Yes, I am aware. You got to love yourself more. I know I am trying, but I cannot. I hate myself so I try to get other people to love me and fill that void Just kick him to the curb I cannot he is my roommate and helps with the bills or else ill probably lose my housingI just hope one day I will stop loving him and stop caring or maybe resent him and move on.I hope I can start loving myself so I can stop relying on other people love. Maybe I did not get loved enough as a child. My childhood was pretty shitty family molestation abuse sucks. I do not know how to love or function as a normal person. :/ Sorry my thoughts were all over the place since I wrote this being all emotional and crying and all. So please do not comment about my grammar and that I should go back to school. I do not need that now. I just wanted to get this out of my system. Thanks again guys. Tonight Sucks...",1

So my girlfriend had some traumatic dating experience. So we had a fight regarding one of the experience and we did not handle it well. We sort of broke up after that but then again patched up. Her past stories kind of hurts me too which is why I cannot listen to them properly and she hesitates as well. So recently she is been feeling really down and got to know that she has depression. I really want to help her go through this phase. Also we cannot afford therapy now. So what should i do to make her feel better and how to deal with her depression. Really need advices My girlfriend has depression and i want to support her in every way I can,1

"ThrowawayIm female, 20 years old. Ever since I was 12 I have been on antidepressants, antipsychotics for severe depression and anxiety. My parents are divorced since I was 2. they have both been in relationships after. I have lived with my mother and majority of my life its just been us two living together. My brother lived with my father. My mother was in a relationship when I was 11. We moved in with him. He abused her mentally and physically. I heard everything. I saw the scars. Fast forward a few years later she dated another guy. I had met this guy before, we lived with him when I was around 7. It did not last. Last year we got a call that he had hung himself. My father does not understand mental illness. He often calls me a baby or a child and tells me to just suck it up. That its all in my head. My one and only serious relationship was with a boy online. It started when I was 14. Went on and off since I was 17. He said he would come to Canada and marry me. We would have an amazing life together and have kids of our own. I was so happy. Everyone around me told me he was mentally abusing me. I did not see it. But he would not let me have friends, he would get insanely jealous. I was not even allowed to go over to my female friends house, and when I did, he would get super angry. He controlled everything in my life. Got upset when I went to school and did not stay home to talk to him. Eventually he left me for one of my other friends online. I begged him to stay, I had never felt so broken. He did not. he would say awful things about me. The anxiety and depression got so bad I could not go to school. By this time, I was in grade 12. Every time I walked in the school, I had a panic attack. could not be around people. I tried online school, I could not do it. It was too difficult without a teacher. I still have not graduated. I have never had a job- its hard to leave my house. I cannot drive. I cannot cook. I cannot do anything by myself, my mother raised me to be super dependant. 3 years ago she started dating a guy (now fiance) she previously was best friends with. He was around me a lot when I was a child. I do not remember much. The meds make me forget most of my life including my school years. First couple years were fine. I eventually got really sick. Last year I developed severe ocd. Contamination ocd. I cannot touch anything he has touched. cannot have him in my apartment. My mother gets angry and blames me that she cannot be happy. I have tried 3 different meds since then, all the free therapists the government gives me. Nothing helps. They say I developed ocd as I most likely have psychological issues with men because of all the wrong they have caused me in my life. My family all acknowledges I need professional psychological help. They do not have the money for it. My mom is on permanent medical assistance as she has severe stage 4 endometriosis. My dad lives with his girlfriend who has kids, they cannot afford me or take me in either. My grandparents just want to live a chill retired life. They do not want me. My brother lives in a different province. This takes me to why I need to get out of here, though I have no place to go. Last night my mom got upset with me and said she wants her life back. she is sick of my mental illnesses and says she is going to have her fianc over. She acts like she forgets that I nearly starved to death last year, literally days away from starving, because I was too scared that what she cooked was contaminated because she was around him. The ambulance was called at my therapists office because he saw that I could barely stand up. I was shaking really bad. I was extremely malnourished. I was not able to shower for the same fear that she contaminated the shower. Again last year my mother called the police on me because I said I did not want to live anymore after she had threatened our relationship if he does not come over. She said that she would not watch movies with me anymore or be around or spend time with me at all (which really affected me because she was like my only friend. do not have barely any irl bc of my anxiety to leave the house and she knows this). Everyone I do talk to says that she emotionally abuses me so bad. I have a video of her saying that our relationship is nothing now anyways. This week she said she was going to lock me out of the fridge for getting a piece of balongne. She said that I have gluten on my hands (she has celiac) even though I did not even touch anything with gluten, and she said that I am probably the reason why she is been sick this past year. She wants to move in with her fianc, and I am the one holding her back. She always makes sure to let me know that I am the reason why she cannot have happiness in her life. She makes me feel like I am just a roadblock. And so much more. So when the police were called they came into our small apartment - 4 men. They forced the blood pressure machine on me even though I was crying telling them its contaminated. They told me to grow up and act like an adult. They told me that since they have been called twice now, that next time they are called they can put me in handcuffs and arrest me. It traumatized me so much. The self harm last year was out of control. Since that year I have gotten so much better by myself since my mother had been cooperating with me, giving me time to get better before she has her fianc over. I do not wear gloves inside my house anymore. I can eat. I can shower. I do not self harm. I have been socializing online a lot. However last night when she said she was going to start having him over I have fallen into some of the same habits. have not really been eating. Been super depressed. Been crying and shaking all day. I am scared it will be as bad as last year - probably way worse if he comes over. Hell contaminate everything just by being in here. I am so scared. I will not be able to leave my closed room. Ill be too afraid to eat or drink anything in fear of it being contaminated. I am so so scared. cannot stop shaking. Threw up after I tried to eat something. Last year I nearly died, I do not know what worse entitles. I am scared. I made so much progress. I do not want it all to be shattered. It will all be for nothing if she has him over. She will not let me get psychological help first either before she has him over. She says she cannot afford it and she is waited long enough. Shaking while typing this. Feel really sick. Stopped talking to my friends. Stopped doing anything except sitting in my room crying. She keeps threatening me that she will call the police again if I do not start eating. She says they will arrest me this time. But I feel so sick. I am so scared. No one can afford help for me. I cannot do anything. I am stuck. What do I do? I have psychological issues with men yet my mom is going to bring a man in the house. I am so scared. She does not care. I have tried reaching out to him personally and our family. No one cares. They all think I am being irrational. And that my mom deserves happiness too. They do not understand. No one does. And I am trapped. All I am is a roadblock. No one wants me. No one can take me. I am trapped in this home. It used to be the only place I feel safe, now its the scariest place. All I do is sleep because its the only time I am at peace. I cry every time I wake up because I realize I have to face this hell. I am trapped. I am scared. I have nowhere to go. What can I even do? I cannot drive to get out of here. I cannot do anything. cannot get a job to afford professional psychological help for myself. I am stuck. And its so so so scary. What can I even do? Throwaway - I need help, advice, anything. I am stuck.",1

"He laid me down and went to take off his clothes, then I sprung up, ran to the bathroom, grabbed the key(only one we have), ran to the guest room and locked myself in there. Finally safe. No pillow or comforter though, just a thin blanket and some clean laundry. No matter, I couldn't fall asleep anyways. Around 6am I crept outside, took a shower, gathered most of his stuff I could find and left him a note saying I took his key, and when I'd be back at 8pm he should be gone and anything that he leaves behind goes to the bin.",0

"Hello everybody, new member here! I'm so glad I found out this sub exists. So, I haven't always had health anxiety, more generalised anxiety, but for the last 6 months I've had obsessive worrying thoughts about getting just one particular neurological disease, I'm almost afraid to say what it's called as that can be a bit of a trigger for me, let's just say it follows me everywhere, everyday and nothing I do can reassure me I'm not in danger f developing this disease. I'm also on the autistic spectrum with OCD traits so this is definitely a big factor in my anxiety.

"30m and well last year I could not actually kill myself so I drank as much as possible my liver checked out and I basically killed myself.

It took another 2 months to go up stairs alone or even do much of anything alone and 3 total months and I was done with the Walker then cane. I have been doing amazing until the past 2 weeks and especially this past week and I am feeling more alone than ever, I feel like a horrible father to my daughter because I am randomly down again I still hate my lying ex wife but that is another long ass story, honestly I am back in the spot I was the past 2 years but this time I have already died so it is not that bad the real pain came in recovery, I am still on my prozac and take it as proscribed also have not touches any type of alcohol or drug since September 6th. I guess my question is do others have the same rollercoaster especially when they know 90 percent of their family dislike them and judge them for a mental illness? Small town Indiana.

"Apologies in advance if this post is long, Ill try to have all the detail in as few words as I can.Quick background: I am about to be a junior in college, good home life, a lot of friends, very intelligent, struggles with anxiety but never anything too extreme.In September of 2020, I suffered a head injury playing pickup football with some friends. It did not feel serious at all and I was back in the game a few minutes later like nothing had happened. The symptoms did not kick in for about 10 days.In hindsight, it was probably a mild concussion and nothing too major. However, I had no idea what I was dealing with, so I treated it probably exactly how you should not treat it. I worried about it constantly and pushed myself with school, partying, etc. there is not a lot of wiggle room when it comes to slowing down in the college life so I just continued to try to push on, which ended up being a bad idea. I was up and down with symptoms for about 6-7 weeks during this time.In late November, I suddenly crashed and everything went to shit again. All of the sudden in the course of a day I became totally dissociated and my brain fog increased tremendously. I thought it was nothing more than a symptom flair at first, but eight months later I still deal with these symptoms 24/7, and they have destroyed my life.I have done everything, seen all the doctors I thought would help, and nothing has given me any relief. I have been constantly dissociated since that time and my brain functions at a fraction of the capacity it used to. It makes life fucking terrible to live. I can still try and do things I did before, but I can never enjoy anything due to the way I constantly feel. My motivation is pretty much gone. Driving feels like a life risking activity every time I do it. School was next to impossible last semester and I am no better for this one coming up.The silver lining is that I think the problem here is that all the worry and anxiety has been trapped in my brain and the trauma surrounding the worrying is the issue rather than the injury itself. I was not officially diagnosed with depression but one doctor thought that is what could be prolonging my issues. Even with this knowledge I cannot find any relief whatsoever. I struggle to tell people this first because its very personal, second because I struggle to share my feelings, and third because I have always been a guy to light up the room and now I have to act because I do not want to bring peoples moods down when they are around me. The people in my life know I am suffering from this but nobody knows the suffering I deal with mentally on a daily basis. I am just very hopeless right now. I wanted to get this off my chest anonymously.",1

"I have been pretty sure i have depression for years. about a year ago i went to my family doctor to get a prescription to go see a clinical psychologist and was diagnosed with depression with anxiety based only on emotional feeling questionnaire (questions about how I have felt the previous month). i did not go to see a psychologist and the prescription expired. so now, a year later things have gotten worse. i got a job where i had huge stress to study four languages (for serving tables at a restaurant) in 2 weeks. i failed first exam and after that i had 2 panic attacks (first was two days after and the second about a week later). with my stress I have had thoughts about offing myself and depressive episodes where i cannot think of anything but how much i hate myself daily for a few hours. i quit that stressful job yesterday because i just could not take it anymore and now i feel a huge relief and I have been starting to think if it was only the stress and i do not really have anything really wrong, that I am just being lazy and unmotivated to do anything as I am not having these depressive episodes daily now. does anyone have any kind of similar experience or does anyone understand this situation? any kind of help would be amazing. i do not understand if I am lazy or is it depression",1

"I have been depressed like, forever but during corona time all have went downhill and fast. it is hard to keep my social skills up as I have no mood or strenght to be social - all I just do is think about my problems and my miserable life. Whole of my childhood I was bullied by others; ""friends"", siblings.. I had to find a way to make other kids to like me but it never really lasted long after they started to bully again.About 8 months ago I faced bullying at work. There was this one person who acted like friend of all people but back stabbed when you turned your back on her. I noticed this and I started to question her methods.. eventually it ended up that she started watching what I do and so on and also started telling other workers about how bad I am and they team up to get me out. I got fired and this case - according to supervisor - was 100% my fault. Ever since that day my life has been hell - total hell. This event greatly affected my life and now I am so lost with my thoughts; ""am I that bad"", ""what I did to deserve this"", ""no one likes me"". I cannot talk with people anymore, not even with my family because I am afraid of it and I feel so worthless. This also affects my relationship and I have a feeling even my boyfriend is having enough of me because I am always depressed and negative. I used to talk alot with him about my problems but nowadays I am afraid to tell him anything because I get always same sighing and tone of his voice is judgmental.I just want to talk with people like normal person, laugh and joke around but no one ever last that long with me.. I barely get any responses from anyone when I try to talk or message - in real life or internet. I just have a feeling I have something in me that makes people aware.. I have lost my appetite as well, barely eat anything (maybe once in a day a hot meal - sometimes forcefully). I am just so lost and exhausted.. just feeling everything I experienced when I was child I need to face it again in adulthood twice harder.. No strenght to keep social bonds up - even with family",1
"Should i be honest and say that i'm shy and worried about that and that i would like them to take control?

"Waiting on results, the last few anxious hours are the worst. I’ve been struggling with medical issues for a while now that are definitely exaggerated by health anxiety which has been hard in many ways. Mainly because I never know when I’m experiencing a real symptom or my anxiety is just getting the best of me. My doc wanted me to see a neurologist who ordered an MRI. I missed the call last night with what I thought would be results which left me waiting all night. I was so ready to call this morning and have my anxiety put to ease but all they said was the results were not specific enough and the neurologist wants to see them himself. So that brings me to now, about 10 am. At 11 I am planning to go grab the disk from the imaging center in my town and then bring it to drop off at my neurologist a little over an hour away. Then I have to drive home and wait for a call again. Ugh I’m so sick of the waiting and I’m scared it’s not a good sign that he needed to see it himself before giving me results.",2

Im just about to go to sleep and i noticed these spasms on my arm and on my leg happening all the time....they aren't violent they are soft and sometimes it feels like it is my blood pulsation....to make things worse i researched about neurological diseases and seen spasms related to ALS and multiple sclerosis and it has been driving crazy...i need to go to a neurologist but these things takes time and the results might be months from now and until there i will suffer this painful doubt about what my problem is...im really scared to be honest, i have developed a couple diseases recently due to the lifestyle of being severely depressed and i got a bunch of health problems...feels these things keep stacking up, health problem after health problem...i had a typical hypochondria episode many years ago that was typically delusional but i thought i overcame it....nowdays whenever my anxiety is high i start worrying about health problems that i already have...and symptoms that i wasn't able to find an answer yet...it is still there and it turns my peace of mind into hell..i dont know what to do about this...i am the kind of person that dont ease up until i get answers...i wont be able to rest until i know what i have and it is psychologically painful",2

"(With picture) Long standing white sore on tonsil causing ear pain and discomfort (should I be worried?) Here is photo: [https://imgur.com/a/ILiQNNC](https://imgur.com/a/ILiQNNC) (warning. picture of tonsils. could be disturbing for some)

White sore located at the top region of my tonsil. Had to use q-tip to see it hidden behind the flap of skin (opening of throat.)

I have ear discomfort and throat discomfort when I swallow.

MORE INFO: I'm 25. I had throat discomfort on one side of throat for 5 months (brushed it off because I couldn't afford a doctor visit.) It felt worse recently, so I looked into my throat and searched around to discover a sore a few days ago. I don't think it's a tonsil stone. Not sure about a canker sore either. I'm worried sick that it could be tonsil cancer. I DO have a doctor visit tomorrow, thankfully. But I'm still worrying myself sickly. Any advice?",2

To start off I have been diagnosed with depression in the past and I know I am currently depressed. But I have no idea why. I am in a happy relationship and live in a nice apartment with everything I could ever need. But I find myself remembering the past and being fond of memories that are long gone. Looking for things that I know are not possible. Feeling unhappy in a relationship that is anything but that. I feel like I cannot talk to anyone about it because everyone is going through their own thing. I have been thinking that I am stuck and I thought I was finally getting out of the funk.

"Reading. Too much of my time is occupied in mindlessness. Getting engrossed in a good story is the perfect practice of mindfulness, and mindfulness is the key to everything. If you do not exercise your conscious cerebrum, your unconscious cerebellum takes over, and that part of your brain does not want you happy. It wants you scared, anxious, discontent and twisted up with longing and regret, because that is how it motivates the actions that keep you alive. It evolved long before complex emotion, and it does not give a damn about your heartache. Your heavy concerns are legitimate, but you are under no obligation to match your mood to your circumstances. How strange that we think we have no say in that! you are entitled to take charge of how you feel and who you are. If reading is not your thing, and you cannot see your way to changing that, find something else that pleasantly engages your full attention, and do it every day. Its not a magic pill, but it is a key to effortlessly tapping into the power you already possess. I have connected every single episode of depression and sadness I experience to the neglect of one single habit.",1
"I have had more downs in my life than ups to be honest but the main core of this situation was and still is because of my parents' we were taught to respect them and love them because they were the ones who raised us and ""put a shelter over ours heads"". For me these last two years were absolute hell and it was not because of the pandemic but there are several reasons like:1. I am pretty smart and got into med university by the age of 17 and because of the amount of stress and trauma I had to deal with I failed2. After failing my parents gave me a second chance to reenter the university and I took it but I was so unhappy that I chose not to do it and went against my parents simply because I was severely depressed and hospitalized due to psychological pains like constant chest pains and I could not breathe3. My parents were not supportive of me. They were supportive when they where showing off to their peers or friends and my dad told me "" You are nothing but a disappointment and you embarrass us wherever we go"" I was highly discouraged4. I still get yelled at and pretty much am verbally insulted and was told I cannot do shit in life because I am a complete failure. I really hated when my dad used to tell me ""You are going to be a doctor so you should know this"". The only thing I know, is that I really really hate you and this hate adds up even more daily.5. I have this new opportunity where I technically can go to another country and go to university there and my parents will not be able to come. I feel so restrained and so closed in like in a box and I suffocate so I feel like I should say fuck you to my parents and leave but I do not know how well I can deal with myself there too6. Technically they killed all my dreams, what I could have became and they took my dreams and crushed it and are the MOST negative people I have ever seen in my life and I do not even want to look at them. I know it is unethical to hate your parents but do not blame the ones they do because some parents clearly suck and I even told them "" You should have never became parents"" or ""I wish I was never born I did not ask to you to be my parents""My parents makes me want to kill myself and have suicidal thoughts and I cannot take it anymore. They do not know how to communicate at all and they have zero empathy and funnily enough my parents hate each other and themselves as well; weird how they have to reflect that on me too. I was an innocent kid with big dreams. I was not born to be insulted like this, they are the fakest people I have ever met too. Acting like they care about me in front of others all the fake hugs and such and ask me why I do not ever let them to hug me; it is because I hate you and I do not want to see you. I do not know what to do anymore...should I leave to another country and do not see them again? It seems pretty huge but I cannot deal with this kind of toxicity anymore.. It feels like it keeps getting worse",1
"Does anyone else get sore aching legs and body pain from being in a constant state of worry and stress I’ve been super stressed and anxious lately because of a lot of stressors at home plus feeling like I have no one to share them with.

In the past 5 months I’ve diagnosed myself with all types of cancers ( because I had blood in my stool due to hemmoroids ) I’ve had swollen nodes in my neck etc. 

My body has acted out in all kinds of ways over the past few months and I’ve been visiting all doctors where nothing major has been diagnosed but I can’t stop worrying. I had got my blood work done 3 months ago and it was all good, now with the body pain I feel like getting it again because I feel like some new cancer mah have developed. 

The past week has been literal hell where my muscles are constantly extremely aching. My legs have been so sore, I wake up every night from 2 AM to 5 AM with leg // stomach pain and anxiety attacks plus my guts have been churning and I’m constantly worrying about things.

I'm not looking for a diagnosis, just people who share my experience or know what I'm talking about. I'm sorry if this seems kind of ranty or rambling, my thoughts are a bit of a mess and I'm not sure what to think. Thank you for reading all this, anyhow.",3
"We had signed up for the boat ride (something she was extremely excited about), but the lines got a little backed up and the time got pushed back. An hour had passed of us at the event and we were scheduled to go on the boat ride in about 15 minutes. However, since that hour had passed, her boyfriend refused to stay any longer and made both of them go home, even though she really wanted to go on the boat. These are some of the bigger events that have pissed me off; however, they have the same fight everyday regarding their differing values, and her wanting to do things/live her life and him refusing to make any sort of sacrifice or compromise to do that with her, resulting in her just settling to the situation. Since graduation, he accepted that crappy job and moved across the country, taking her with him.",0

Everyone has cancer and it freaks me out. I’ve been having a lot of cancer surrounding my friends and family as time passes I become more and more afraid of when it is going to inevitably strike close to home. I am terrified of a possibility that someone I love or even myself can get hit by the big C. Does anyone else struggle with this? ,2
"I am literally at my breaking point. I seriously don’t know what to do or even where to begin with all of this. Please bear with me, I know I’m likely going to be all over the place. 

Ok, for starters I am a 38 year old female with a pretty lengthy history of health anxiety, regular anxiety - if it’s anxiety related, I probably suffer from it. I worry about EVERYTHING. It’s as if I just get a simple thought in my head I have to run with it to the extreme. I have had every disease imaginable. MS, multiple types of cancer, the list could go on forever.... 

I see a psychiatric NP who has tried to put me on some different medication, which I cannot take. Once I read the side effects forget it. All bets are off and I just suffer. I do take a low dose of Xanax, which helps me in the midst of a really bad time, but I haven’t taken anything long term. I’ve seen therapists in the past and to be honest they were not that helpful. I assume just not the right fit or whatnot. 

Usually when my HA hits it will last for a couple of weeks or so and then I get over whatever my problem is at that time. I’ll do ok for a while and then it’ll dawn on me that, wow, I’ve been feeling pretty good lately! That’s when my brain is like “here, hold my beer”. Then all fucking hell breaks loose... which leads me to today. 

I’ve been having stomach issues for a while now.  A variety of symptoms that are all over the place. I went to my GP who did bloodwork. According to them, it was normal. I saw a gastroenterologist yesterday who isn’t overly concerned, but we’re doing an ultrasound and an endoscopy to just rule stuff out. Great. 

When I was at my GP appointment she asked me a bunch of questions. Blood in stool? No. Night sweats? No..... Wait, after I thought about this I realized I DO get night sweats sometimes. It’s not all the time, but it’s definitely happened a handful of times that I can remember. Like pretty bad too. Of course I didn’t tell her this because by the time I remembered I was long gone. What could night sweats possibly mean? Don’t worry - Dr. Google to the rescue. Lymphoma, leukemia?! Wtf. Now I’m losing my mind with worry. 

Next up. I have this weird hard area in my mouth. Looks like a mandibular tori. Of course I’m freaking out about this too. I go to the dentist religiously and I’m going to call them Monday morning just to make sure but in the meantime I’m seriously losing it.

I’m so concerned about my mental health. I need help. The only good thing about any of this is... I took half a pill of the lexapro I was prescribed that has been sitting on my nightstand for the last 6 months. I know it’s not doing anything right now, but I at least took it which is a huge step for me. 

All I can do is hope for peace and try to find a way to enjoy my life. I want to live! I am just debilitated and heated down by my anxiety. If it even is anxiety and not some terrible disease after all. 

Honestly, I just want to know I’m not alone in the way I feel. And I feel completely and utterly alone. Nobody understands. If you suffer from HA, or my ridiculous story is at all relatable to you, please by all means I would love to hear what you have to say. I just want to feel better. Thanks ",2
"Tunnel vision when going cross-eyed?  My friend found this 'thing' you can do with your eyes, so I tried it and now I'm abit freaked (more than abit), wondering if anyone can explain it. So this doesn't seem to work inside, only in bright sunlight as far as I've noticed. If you stand outside, in the sunlight(bright) and get in a spot where your side vision is showing the blue sky or something you can clearly see and isn't crowded/moving - then begin by putting your finger infront of your face in-line with your nose, slowly move it in until it's touching the tip of your nose (so you're now crossed-eyed), you'll notice the 'sides' of your vision in each eye have a tunnel-vision kind of effect and go black, once you stop being cross-eyed, it dissapears. why? Going crossed-eyed straight away also does this. can someone please explain this or atleast go out of your way to try and do it just so I'm not so alarmed. you know how HA can be :(",2

"I can't keep going on with my life I can't keep going on

What can I say? I'm depressed, very hard to find motivation to move on, to complete tasks. I'm in college now, and studying became so hard I can't describe. In school I was one of the best students and a couple years later remembering and learning even a tiny pieces of new information is extremely hard. Even if it's something relatively easy. Back in the daysI could read for hours, not only fiction literature, but books about history, science and everything. Now I'm barely completing the minimum to stay in college.

I'm trying to be more socially active, go outside, go to gym, try to learn something new every day but everything stays the same. Well, not exactly the same, because it just keeps getting harder.

I don't believe I'll be able to finish college, find love(I'm really bad at social interactions and meeting new people), find a job, and become happy. Every day it is only harder and harder to move on and deal with problems.
I've also fallen in love with a girl that don't find me interesting.
I hate being in love, because it never plays well, and in the end, all relationships I had, ended badly. My last gf dumped my on my birthday more than a year ago and I spent next half year to recover from that. Than I have fallen in love with this girl, we had some nice conversation and I did fall in love, but she didn't. Of course I'm not blaming her for that but damn, I haven't fallen in love like this since the second grade, my feelings for her are so strong. I usually lose the ability to speak adequately and formulate thoughts when I am around her.
On the bright side, two weeks ago I bought myself an acoustic guitar, which was my little dream for a couple of years, and I'm making some progress in that direction. And this despite the fact that never in my life I've done anything even relatively connected to music. But I like it.

Peace to everyone who read this to the end. Hope you're doing okay.",1

"I wish I had died last year.I could not create anything today. I could barely sing. I feel like when quarantine began, I was meant to kill myself.

Right when I started singing, I thought about how much I just want to stop doing anything anyone wants me to do. I do not want to sing. I do not want to be complimented. I do not want to be in a world full of people who wish the best for me and always want me to become something great, when all I want to do is die.I am not looking forward to anything.

"Is this health anxiety?! Or something else Hello all, if you take time to read and respond to my post I thank you.

To begin ive been dealing with health issues since early September (about 4 months now). Could possibly be lyme or something else but the results were not very cut and dry. Ever since these health issss started ive been weighed down by “brain fog” or at least thats how I describe it to doctors. Ive read a bit about brain fog on here but my symptoms seem a bit different, could this still be alk anxiety (most of my doctors have labled this as my issue)

My symptoms of what i call “brain fog” is mainly visual, things look and seem a bit “off/weird” not exactly blurry but just off. This feeling has been with me before (when i had mono 2 years ago) but it only lasted about 3 weeks, this time has been about 3 months constantly. My other symptoms are daily headaches, dizzy/unstable feeling, a feeling or fuzzy/congestion in my head (not really in sinuses but in head) and just feeling out of it.

I read a lot on this reddit about not being able to remember things or think clearly/concentrate. I dont have these issues, mine seem to be mainly visual paired with headaches. Is this being caused by my health anxiety? If not do you have any ideas?

Ive had an MRI, two CT scans and tons of bloodwork done in the last three months. All normal except my lyme came back positive. However after antibiotic treatment and still seeing strange results from bloodwork we are thinking it could be a false positive.  I definitely have anxiety about my health (been a rough few months) but I feel like of it was anxiety it wouldn’t be causing these constant all day symptoms!  Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks all! Any feedback is amazing.",2

"Healthy anxiety is literally going to kill me (Sorry for the essay) Okay so you're all going to probably think I'm a nut job and you're probably right.. I've been a bit of a hypochondriac since a child but it's gotten way worse in recent years (I'm now 27). I actually don't even know what to do anymore? I went to counselling about this last year and it did zilch! The past year has been my absolute worst!!!

I'm a Googler and it's really starting to piss me off! Every single pain I get I end up googling it and lose my shit thinking it's cancer or something deadly. Heck, sometimes I don't even Google it and I just assume it's something bad! The anxiety got that bad in the summer time that I was crying every night and having no sleep thinking I was going to die and couldn't get out of bed for work. I'd literally made my self depressed. I then did actually get really ill from all the worry and stress. I just don't want to have death thoughts everytime I feel a pain or a niggle! I'm even getting scared of feeling my own breasts incase I feel a lump!!! I also hate it when I see articles on Facebook telling you the symptoms to look out for for certain cancers and then those symptoms are stuck in my brain for life and I end up tying those symptoms to my pains and thus the anxiety begins! I'm literally stressed and on edge every single day now, it's exhausting!

So my question is, is there anybody else out there suffering with this too? And how are you coping with it? I literally can't go on like this, feeling like i'm going to die all the time. It's an absolute waste of life.

"EKG changes and CT? Greeting, my anxious friends.  


I'll cut right to the chase!

&amp;#x200B;

From April 2018 - November 18th, I went to the hospital 14 times or so, each time with the same symptoms; feeling of rapid heartbeat, chest pain, profuse sweating and feeling of impending doom. Each time I had an EKG and bloodwork done and the results have always been perfectly normal. I've also had a Holter done in addition to several other monitors during admission.  


When I went to the hospital on November 13th my EKG was perfectly normal. When I went to the hospital again on November 18th, I suddenly had inverted Ts in my ST-segment, which they said could be indicative of insufficient oxygen to the heart muscle. From November 18th - present, I've had additional EKGs done which show the same change, but the doctors say that the EKGs, even with the change, is still perfectly normal. Some say there is no ischemia and that my heart is perfectly healthy, others say that they aren't concerned at all and that they don't suspect anything.  
I also had an extensive ultrasound done in November, which shows nothing abnormal. Valves are fine, no endocarditis, no extra sounds. Heart monitor during admission shows nothing abnormal either.  


Still, I am scheduled for a CT on January 22nd to rule out any atherosclerosis/blockages and I am scared to death of the pre-op medication they want to give me to lower my heart rate to between 40-50BPM.  


My question to the community is: Have you heard of depression/anxiety causing changes in your EKG? If you Google it, there is one article out of Columbia University that specifically mentions ST-inversions in patients with depression/anxiety.  


I am 27 years old, 190lbs, 6'4"" - I eat healthily and I've never smoked. I don't drink or do drugs either. The odds of me suddenly having ischemia, especially from one week to the next, is atomically small.

But then I get my head out the clouds and come back to reality. I realize how far deep I am into my depression and how pointless it would be for me to try because its all too much considering how I am feeling. I mean I can barely brush my teeth how the hell would I change my life around? Its like the deeper I sink into the pit of depression the dimmer the light at the end of the tunnel is.

I do not enjoy doing anything. Literally. I am just on autopilot, in a constant state of numbness. Its like I am just a ball and chain for my wife to carry around. Of course she is tired of it, who would not be. She does not understand the constant pain I am in. She does not understand that she is the only reason I am even keeping on going. Opening up to her just causes her pain because I know she just wants me to be happy with her. The thing is though, I would not be anywhere as happy as I am now without her. she is my world. I just do not know what to do. I feel guilty for her having to be around me like this. I feel like I have to wear a mask all the time",1

"Having anxiety and PTSD over being excluded from a reunion. Toxic ex-friend who socially traumatized me was invited.  **TL;DR: Having very mixed feelings over a reunion that I was not invited to but I feel I should have been, plus a former friend who socially traumatized me was invited**

Backstory: I am a pro player at a certain game. I went viral on YouTube and Reddit (different profile). The game's official YouTube channel's video of my gameplay has over 5M views and is the third most-viewed video on the channel. I had worked with the game's PR on stuff in the past and was always welcome at events and such.

I befriended many other players of this game over social media. I deactivated Facebook in early 2021 because I realized my mental health issues were showing and people were leaving group chats because of me and even unfriending me. I decided to deactivate before I ruined any friendships that meant a lot to me. I still maintain strong friendships with many of my fellow players.

For many years, the makers of the game said that they would never do a tournament or any kind of ""bring together the best players"" event because the player base is just too large and because the game is very luck-based (but if you're like me, you can sort of manipulate your odds). This year, a new person was put in charge of the game and they have decided to finally have a special event reuniting ""fan favorite"" players in person, most of whom went viral in the same way I did.

15 people were invited, and I was not one of them. The day the invitations went out, I got several messages from fellow players asking me, ""Did you get invited to the thing?"". Many in the community were shocked I was not, and one of them said ""They're missing out without you"". When I found out this was happening, I started trembling with anxiety for multiple reasons. One being that I was overthinking why I wasn't invited and paranoia that I may be blacklisted (I have been very vocal about the game's flaws on social media). One thing that got me was that around the time my gameplay was posted, I was often grouped with two other great players in promotional stuff and we were kind of like the de-facto ""GOAT trio""; we were the top three viewed videos on the YouTube channel at the time, though a couple have snuck between us since then. These two people were both invited to the reunion event. I am so happy for those who were invited and I'm trying to convince myself that not everyone could get this opportunity, but I can't help but feel hurt and worried.

The ""reunion"" happened today, and I purposefully avoided everyone's social media so I wouldn't have to see photos or anything of them hanging out at bars or restaurants and stuff afterwards. I suffer from FOMO big time. I've flown out to events that friends went to just to avoid FOMO, but I didn't have time to fly out for this reunion even to just stop by and say hi. The event is not being publicized until May, so I'm going to have to deal with this feeling again in a couple of months.

Part of the reason I am anxious about this whole thing is because one of the players who was invited to the reunion is a former close friend of mine. We bonded over the game of course, and his high score blew mine out of the water. We discovered we had a lot in common. He also suffers anxiety and he gave me advice on what meds are better than others; I still take the one he recommended me to this day. We're also both gay, and I found him very attractive (as did many others in our community). Our friendship shattered when I went to visit him in person (across the country) and he showed very manipulative behavior that I was too naive to discern at the time. He purposefully distanced himself from me whenever we were in a room together (e.g. sitting on a different couch) and excluded me from ""parties"" he went to while I was in town to prevent anything sexual happening between us, and lying about them. He had been sending me several pictures of him shirtless and in bed with other guys we knew, knowing it would turn me on, among many other forms of leading me on, but never had the courage to say ""I don't like you like that"". Instead, he let me come all this way and then gaslit me for trying to come on to him, saying it was inappropriate behavior (behavior that he exhibited with other guys right in front of me, and said ""It's different with them"" when I asked). We tried to move on from that experience while staying friends, but then he kept making jokes about me with the other guys and I got tired of it. We haven't spoken in months, and when we did speak, it was only because he had a question about the game.

I suffered so much social trauma from this person I trusted, and his group of friends who seemed like a Mean Girls Plastics clique that acted polite around me but I later realized they didn't care about me one way or the other. I followed all of them on Instagram and only one followed me back. These people ostracized and humiliated me on top of my friend's various forms of mental and emotional abuse. The trauma only started setting in as months passed and I started crying myself to sleep and sort of ""reenacting"" the day everything happened in my head wishing I was more assertive. Now I get PTSD at the mention of his name, and I deleted almost every picture I took on my trip to meet him. So since he was invited to the reunion, I might have declined if I was invited so I wouldn't have to be in the same room as him, because it would have been so triggering for me and I would not have been able to concentrate on the game. That being said, I would definitely be willing to take a day to have a serious discussion with this person over how he made me feel and maybe we could start over strictly as friends, because I do think he is a good person.

I really hope come May when the reunion is made public that I don't suffer any more PTSD. I hope I can find some healthy distractions.

Has anyone ever been in a situation like this involving being excluded from an outing involving a traumatic person from your past?",2
"So I have been a long time reader on here and I figured this would be the best place for help.So about four months ago I started feeling aloof, I guess you would call it, but I have been feeling worse and worse. All the things that used to really make me feel good now just kind of feel like chores. Never really feel like leaving my room. I am 28 this month and I am not sure if I am just feeling down or if depression is what I am experiencing. I have had periods like this in the past but I have been told there is no reason for me to be depressed and usually I take it on the chin and keep walking forward because that is ""what I am supposed to do"". do not really have any real friends so any advice would be much appreciated I could use some perspective",1

"Dry heaving I’ve been dealing with a really complex personal issue involving heartbreak/ loss of a person I deeply care about; certainly the worst pain I’ve experienced in my life thus far. As it stands, I already carry a level of anxiety with me, but with this added on to it, my body has been putting me through hell. I find myself dry heaving hard in the mornings especially, and then at times throughout the day. This has led to some really painful vomiting on several occasions. Its also occurred at my workplace, the gym, and several other public places without warning. I know there’s absolutely a psychosomatic part of all of this, but after almost three weeks, it’s becoming really problematic for me. 

Has anyone experienced something similar? Is this just something I have to power through? Are there any tricks to at least minimize it?",2

"Hair turning white I'm so unbelievably fucking stressed out and want to vent right now since I can't scream and punch things

I've never been so fucking financially and emotionally stressed out in my fucking life

-Stuck on a night shift working 10 hours a day for pay way under what I deserve for my experience and schooling

-2k in credit card debt due to stupid fucking bullshit coming out of nowhere and having to shell out money for it

-used up most of my TFSA because of stupid fucking covid hitting literally the same month of buying my first ever home and losing my good paying job due to the company using covid as a scapegoat and ""selling the company"" when in reality, the assholes fired all but 8 people and kept operations open

-girlfriend (should be fiancé but can't even spare 500 bucks for a decent engagement ring right now) is stuck in workers comp hell because of a work injury. They didn't send her any fucking money for months then sent her a big lump sum of money, and now a month later claim they overpaid her a grand and she has to pay it back, leaving me to cover the house payments until she can afford to help again. Seriously, WCB is a fucking joke with a bunch of dumbass monkeys working for them.

- stuck with a shitty car that has way too many problems for being bought brand new in 2018 and the dealership is just as shitty as WCB and actively try to fuck me over (as all dealerships do)

My goddamn hair is turning white and I'm so full of just pure rage most of the time now that I get frequent migraines.

Anyone else want to just explode and go fucking crazy on a punching bag for hours straight all the time or is it just me?

I know I should probably find a therapist, but even finding a family doctor right now has been a nightmare since I can't afford to fucking miss work and my old doctor left the damn province.

"I am hurting so much. I thought I was done with depression but apparently its not done with me. Everything I touch turns to shit. I cannot do anything right, I cannot even be mentally ill right. I am tired of people telling me that I am not ill as much as I believe I am. I am tired of being invalidated, I am tired of invalidating myself. All these comments make me believe that I created chronic pain that I somehow wanted it to get out of life, that I created depression and anxiety for attention. The worst part is I actually feel these things and its real to me. Every little thing that resulted me in feeling like this was real but it feels like more should happen. Somehow none of it was enough for me to qualify feeling like this. When I was a teen I was severely bullied, as a child I was so anxious and stressed that I pulled my lashes and eyebrows out. I self harmed for years (I do not anymore). I drank and smoked weed to get rid of the pain. I was pee on peer sexually assaulted in school, drugged and sexually assaulted which was so close to being a full blown rape had not I been saved when I was 18. Emotionally abused in relationships, overdosed, Abused by dad and emotionally neglected. Is this not enough? People make me feel like I have it easy. My mum constantly tells me to well look at others pain and be grateful that it is not me. But their pain is not mine. Why do I have to be grateful for my pain because someone has it worse. I am a sham of a person. I do not know what to do Everything is a mess and I cannot cope anymore",1

"walking mess yesterday at work i would be drinking water normally and would notice a sharp pain at the top of my head but would think nothing of it at first. several sips later, the sharp, almost electrifying pain would occur in the same exact spot it had before. so i kept sipping and noticed that it only hurts at first, and the pain goes away if i continue to drink repeatedly. fell asleep with hopes of waking up with it being gone but unfortunately the first sip i took gave me the same incredibly sharp pain in the same exact spot. i can swallow my own saliva and eat food without any problem.. when i’m not drinking anything i can still feel a slight pulsating pain in the top part of my head, my left eye is spasming uncontrollably, and my ear on the same side hurts when i apply pressure to it. i’ve tried researching the pain to see if it’s worth visiting a health care professional but can’t seem to find anything. should i be worried more than i already am?",2

"Antibiotic cocktail and side effects Disgusting me has a bacterial infection in the stomach and I'll have to take 15 pills every day of antibiotics to get rid of it. Normally I won't take a look at the side effects because I know I will go insane about them, but after my mother saw the prescription she said I should consider another form of antibiotic treatment that only has 70% success rate (compared to 95%) but less side effects. SO I looked up the side effects and its worse than anything I've ever taken. It's nausea and diarrhea and vomiting in over 10% of cases and a condition with black burnt skin and multiple organ failure with unknown probability. As I'm already vegetarian and you're not allowed to eat dairy products I have to go vegan for a week and I'm not allowed to go outside in the sun cause the medication will cause my skin to burn in the sun.

I can't find the side effects for the other therapy but I also I want to be done with the whole thing if I survive the ten days.  I'll probably take the pills but I will properly go crazy and miserable too.",2

"I’ve recently lost an invaluable watch and gold chain that was passed down from my family. I’ve also been sick for a month. I am also a very isolated person. I’m a first year teacher; tomorrow is my formal, which is one of the most important days of the year for my career. I get evaluated on my performance.

I’ve never missed a day of work until this month; I was so sick that I was sent to the ER. That was two weeks ago. Then I couldn’t chew, my wisdom teeth were gnawing at me, and the gum over the tooth got infected. Now I have a cold as well.

Within this time, I’ve lost my gold chain, an invaluable item with massive sentimental value. I received it from my parents when I graduated from my masters. I wore it everywhere.

I haven’t been sleeping. I’ve cut off the few friends I have entirely for weeks. My co-workers know something is off, but I put on a smile at work.

I am absolutely broken. I’ve had close to no sleep these past few days. I’ve found no enjoyment in anything and have had no appetite.

I haven’t been happy for years. I have isolated myself due to the pressures of work; and have lost a lot of friendships and relationships because of it. But these past few events have been stacking on and I don’t know if I can take this anymore. I have rigorously searched everywhere for this gold chain, but I think I’ve lost it at the gym or at the library on Monday. I’ve called both.

My thoughts are everywhere, I apologize if this is not comprehensible.

I’m been sad for months due to other things but it feels like I have a curse, or a bad omen following me this month. I don’t know what to do, or who to talk to. I can’t speak to my friends, it’s so embarrassing. My life feels like it’s been falling apart at a slow and steady pace and this is the huge finale.",1
"Convinced myself I have Huntington's disease The rational side of me knows that these symptoms have either been there for a while or they can easily be explained by any number of other less serious causes. Not to mention that as far as I know, *no one in my family has this disease.*

I was reading about Lewy body dementia and someone had described it as being a mix of Parkinson's, dementia, and Huntington's, the last of which I'd never heard of. So I went to learn about it and since I'm me, I started drawing parallels between the symptoms and things I've either been experiencing or that I wasn't experiencing until they were suggested.

Firstly, I'm in the typical age range when symptoms manifest. My confusion, occasional inability to understand things, indecisiveness, occasional problems with concentration, forgetfulness and fatigue must be due to this disease, not because I never get enough sleep. My bouts of dizziness/vertigo are the coordination problems, even though they're most likely a mix of exhaustion and severe tension headaches. I've noticed lately my index finger on my right hand sometimes twitches when I hold it just right on my mouse, never mind the fact that I've had that happen before with other parts of me if I position myself a certain way. Fidgeting must be a symptom too, even though I've fidgeted my WHOLE LIFE. Me being freezing cold must be the telltale tremors! And the anxiety and depression I've had for what feels like forever MUST be Huntington's too, right? Muscle stiffness can't possibly be due to me being out of shape! My inability to remember a word now and again or have words come out coherently must be from illness and not the fact that my brain to mouth filter has always been haywire. I have issues swallowing and breathing that *could* be due to Huntington's... or, you know, the esophagus problems I've been having.

Also read that one possible symptom is ""visual disturbances"" and lately I've been experiencing what looks like rippling water in my left eye. I realize that could be any number of things and generally as long as my vision itself is okay, it's nothing major. But if I was thinking rationally, I wouldn't be posting here.

And while the disease seems to be hereditary, all I had to do was read something about how only a majority of cases are inherited, implying that some people (1%-3% of cases) can still develop it even with no family history.

Not to mention that practically all these symptoms can be caused by *ANXIETY* too. Never mind I had a CT about a year ago (when many of these same things were happening) that was normal. Never mind it's rare (something like 15,000 people in the entire US have it). NOPE, must be Huntington's!",2

Ill be with bio dad for three weeks. He is not a nice or reasonable person and I cannot stand being around him. that is why I hate going to visitation.Today I kept putting off packing my bags. Doing my laundry was too emotional. I could not bring myself to leave the living room where my family was. I felt so guilty when I went to my room for the night because it felt like I was leaving them behind.Like I said in the title I barely ate today because the idea of going on visitation was just too much. While I am with bio dad I am genuinely terrified that Ill stop eating. Like Ill be away from all the people I actually care about and there will be nothing keeping me accountable. I am already underweight so I cannot be losing weight anywayWhat I was thinking of doing was sending my mom a list of my meals from that day if I do start to eat less. That way she could tell me that I am not eating enough or if she is seeing patterns that I am not. Is this even a good idea? She has really bad anxiety and I would not want to worry her. Same with my step dad. I guess I could send the list to one of my friends but it would be random since my friends do not know about my mental issues.Anyone have any input? Id appreciate anything I go to visitation tomorrow. I barely ate today because I could not handle the anxiety. I am worried Ill lose the motivation to eat entirely while I am visiting. I do not know how to keep myself accountable,1

I literally she would tears.I have also agreed with her mom to fly over there and spend a week or so with them soon.My life has been just a black hole for many weeks now and it is so incredibly refreshing to poke your head above the water and see at least a glimmer of hope and sunshine.

"Kidney like symptoms? Hey guys,

the last days after i got officially diagnosed with anxiety disorder i went without any symptoms (i guess finaly having a name for my problems calmed me down).

But two hours ago when i came back from a walk my left back side under the rib started to hurt :/

It not a stinging pain or something that i can't manage, but it feels a little bit like back pain and is slightly pulsating i think??

It also radiates a little bit to the right side and i am feeling a bit dizzy/out of myself right now :(

I went to pee and it came out like normal without any pain, so It shouldn't be my kidneys right?

This dizziness scares me so much though :(

Has anyone ever experienced something like this?

Or maybe i should really call an ambulance?

"Recently my mother asked me if I was afraid of dieing. I told her part truths. The part I told her was no I am not scared of death, we all are going to die at some time and it means there is no more pain or taking medication to get through the day. The part I did not share is that I actually have thoughts of ending my life daily. I would not act on it as I know it would traumatise my nephew and he calls me his best friend. Another reason is because I am scared of not being successful and ending up trapped in my body. My mind working but I am unable to communicate my wishes so I have somebody else making decisions that they believe Id want but in reality is what they would want me to want. I had a cancer scare and I decided before getting the results that I would not receive treatment as I personally believe life has been wasted on me so no death does not scare me.

"Just needed to vent and I honestly cannot say this to anyone IRL. The bar is this coming Tuesday. I have not studied in any capacity. I just could not bring myself to commit. I was barely taking care of myself as it was. And that is the thing, I cannot even say that I want to kick myself or that I regret it. My mental health was literally just so poor that if I actually participated in the study schedule/grind, I feel I would have been worse off for it. For context, this summer is the only time I have gone days without brushing my teeth and struggled to get out of my bed. I have had two major depressive periods in the past and neither time was I at this level of neglect. I wish I would have just signed up for the later date, but that is not what you are suppose to do. You are supposed to graduate and immediately study full-time for 8 weeks. I even started early technically, but I put in one full days worth of work and just...stopped. I said oh after graduation when its official to start is when Ill pick it back up...but I did not. And very early on I already felt like I was so behind. I had people asking me what my progress percentage of my bar prep course was at during graduation (we did not even need to technically start yet!!) and it freaked me out. I basically decided at the beginning of July that I was too behind with only 4 weeks left, so it was not possible and I was going to fail. And I gave up even pretending to schedule studying.Part of the issue is/was covid. I felt like a real law student with real obligations, benefits, and consequences before this. Then we went online for the remainder of my degree program. I instantly lost focus and drive. None of it felt real or worthwhile anymore. I could now BS my way through my classes (school had relaxed grading policies) and when it came time to actually learn for the bar, I was incredibly overwhelmed.And hell even if I studied studied, there was never a guarantee that I would pass, but there is absolutely no chance for me to pass now. I do not care what any of my peers have to say about me not passing because well, I did not actually study, and regardless of that, peer pressure just has not ever been a motivator for me. I wish I did care what they thought in actuality because I am completely lacking motivation. My family is truly supportive and I know already they will not think badly of me. But they have checked in practically everyday. And I lie and say I studied when I did not. I cannot tell my friends because I know they all are studying by the stuff they send me. All this to say, I feel very alone at this time in my life.I cannot back out of the exam now so I am treating it like a practice test as I have heard others suggest. I can and will retake it next year. I already know that I am changing my environment so I will not be so isolated, which will help. I know in the end everything will probably be okay. I think it speaks loads that even as I am writing this with the test days away, I do not have that much anxiety. This entire time I have been numb. I am sure I will probably freak out during the test. I hope that this experience will actually motivate me in the end. If you read all this, thanks for listening. I am going to fail the bar exam",1

After a lot of advice I finally moved on from my toxic ex because my depression kept getting worse witb her. But now I have moved on and found peace and i cannot help but to feel as if I do not deserve it. It seems like my mental illness truly impacts every part of my life even when I get something right I finally moved on from my ex,1

"I Love you ALL! Last year March I experienced my first panic attack followed by a few more which led me to a spiral of anxiety and health anxiety which I didn’t even know was a thing till recently. I felt so alone especially when I looked around at everyone else and they seem to be fine and dandy. After searching this thread and reading everyone’s posts has given me a lot of hope and can’t thank everyone enough for contributing their experiences and how they’ve managed or beat their anxieties.

Battling this awful feeling has made me appreciate everything in life a whole lot more and to love A LOT More. Also To not take life so damn seriously and to remember that we are human and that life is short. Anyways just wanted to thank everyone in this community for all the support and informative threads. I Love you ALL! God Bless!",2

"I have feelings for my friend who also has depression and past significant trauma which is his Tory not mine to tell. And I just feel so broken. He knows how I feel. We are not talking right now and it hurts. He says he cannot be any type of support especially emotional support, he never had it and does not know what to do (yet he has done things I consider emotionally supportive). I see people mention not being able to have empathy with others or other things when it comes to being depressed. I do not understand that. I have too much empathy, I feel too much all the time. I hurt easily and just feel unloveable. I just want to understand his side and would like to know what is going on in his head. But I know I cannot, I cannot force anyone to talk.

"Hypochondria as an early symptom of dementia? I decided to take a break from scaring myself to death with medical craziness online and (for once) actually wanted to learn about Hypochondria (I guess you could say it was an eye opening moment where I, myself, saw myself from a logical standpoint). 

As I sifted through the Google pages, I ended up coming across a slew of articles relating to Hypochondria being one of the earliest signs of Frontotemporal Lobe Dementia and Lewy Body Dementia. My first initial reaction was complete anger. I had abused my Google privileges for so long, looking at the scariest possible diseases. The one time I do exactly what people have been telling me to do (""dude, look up what ANXIETY does to your body and mind, not this"") I get forced back into hell. 

As you can imagine, I checked it out. There were actually many articles and case reports regarding it that it kinda scared me. I had been worried specifically about dementia for the past month for a bunch of odd-and-end reasons..and then Google relays the term in reference to my hypochondria/anxiety...? It is the coincidence now that is flipping me out and confirming my fear even more. That is some bizarre..not even intentional coincidence, dont you think? 

How do you even distinguish the difference between hypochondria as a VERY early symptom of dementia vs hypochondria because you are a hypochondriac?",2

"if I told my entire story, it would be too long so I apologize if things are confusing (also I apologize if some things seem or sound off, I dropped out when I was around 14 and I am nearly 18 now)I never had a good family life as we grew up in poverty making it worse with also having an abusive and neglectful mother and father.I have always been a loner with no friends and a drug problem that started when I was 13-14 because of my parents. I was being bullied for my looks or how awkward I was, which was just another reason for my downwards spiral. I used drugs heavily for a couple years of my life up untill I was 16. I still use them but just not as much anymore.I have a boyfriend of nearly three years now, but lately he is been ghosting me and other stuff, just not paying me any mind. he says he is been busy with school and such but I usually see him online on social medias and when he texts me, it is usually for things he needs like gas money.he says he loves me, but does not show it or sometimes, he will say he never meant anything. I am way too emotionally attached to him to break up which is a bad thing that I am trying my best to work on. I have tried to commit suicide countless times but they have all failed. I just do not know what to do with my life anymore. I tried going back to school but because of my poor social skills I just dropped out again. I cannot even get a job, and it is my fault. there is nothing left for me anymore, I am honestly contemplating suicide. I give up",1

"This hurts my soul because I just finished silently crying.. I have severe ptsd affiliated with cannabis ( using that term because any other will just mess me up again ) and since I have people that will wonder why, and why I have a hatred to it.. a couple years ago my sister had just started and was using a vape that had cbd or thc in it. Her and her bf were taking turns using it and me being stupid I asked to take a hit from it, the feeling it gave me was strange, i coughed a lot and made me woozy. I made the mistake of asking for another, I only got for like a second and I erupted into coughing my ass off, I coughed all the air in my lungs out multiple times, felt like I was going to die either to my lungs collapsing or suffocating, I managed to catch my breath after coughing it all out at least 3 times.. by then, I had already been traumatized from fighting for my life for a good 5 minutes.. I felt lightheaded, my heart was racing and I was breathing extremely fast. I do not remember the high at all because of what happened. Ever since that day I have gotten slightly better in, talking about it does not hurt anymore, but triggers include smell and watching as someone does it. I did not watch my sister do it today, but the smell, soon as it hit me I rushed outside, holding my breath until then. Went to my car and silently felt everything again, I just on a strong face for my sister when she asked me if I was okay. She went inside after a few minutes. And I just silently started crying because I remember everything about that day, fighting, fear, everything.. kept in mind I am really good at holding myself back, acting stronger than I actually am. Anyways, thanks for listening to me.. I cannot speak right now but I am better .. Ptsd and silent tears today..",1

"Remember that all we have is 'on loan' from Fortune, which can reclaim it without our permission - indeed, without even advance notice. Thus, we should love all our dear ones, but always with the thought that we have no promise that we may keep them forever - nay, no promise even that we may keep them for long. ~ Lucius Annaeus Seneca (Cannot find the source)The most sobering thought is losing what we care about. Would we be able to move on, survive and flourish without our loved ones, whether they have passed on or we have? Some of us, I think. I can say that I have experienced enough of loss to understand that life goes on with or without me, and I can say that I would feel a pang of sadness whensoever their memory comes to mind. But I feel I would do this survival thing just as well if not better after that loss.I would not sully their memory by grieving them for the rest of mine. I would remember them by being better than they remember, so that, should we reunite wherever the universe decides we do, they would enjoy seeing me again, and sharing in my joys instead of my sorrows. I would like to imagine that this is how the old peoples did it.Bare with me, I have a silly idea that maybe, when the Norse, Greeks, Egyptians, Celtics and more, spoke about the idea of death, and what it was to live life after (because surely they did), they sat around their grand tables, talking of stories they heard as children, told to them by their parents, who were in turn told by their parents, and so on until the first story was made up in an answer to the age old question no one can answer. What happens after death? On a side note, I like to think the first story ever came to existence because a a child had asked this in front of the elder of the tribe, who had made his living from leading the tribe that trusted him. This elder never would have led his people wrong, and they would have led a happy, content life. This elder would be the one the whole tribe went to for advice. So of course, he did not want to let the child down. So he told a story. Something from his dreams that were impossible. And he took bits from others dreams and weaved a world after death.And people believed it. Because the elder never lied to them. The elder always led them in the right direction. The elder had lived the longest so the elder knew more than they they. The elder experienced the most out of them all. The elder would know. So they added to his story on death, and made up the gods, and the fantastical dragons, and other beasts of lore. They made up their magics and prophecies. All chasing after their own form of heaven after death, while others would forever be stuck in a hell of their own making. So that is how we got these gods and myths and legends. And that is why stories are so powerful, especially for a child's imagination. The fortunate child who does not fully understand the idea of loss and death, and is fueled on bedtime tales. Until they experience it, of course. And then they have to rely on what is told to them by the elders they know, and they carry that with them. And so it creates a ripple effect, their idea of after life pervading into all that they say and do. And that is how they cope with losing loved ones. They tell themselves over and over again, they are in Odin's hall, or at Arthur's table, drinking their mead and telling their tales of glory. Being happy. So if, after you die, you go to join them at the table, and they want to hear your tales of glory, would you tell sad stories about how you have missed them, and how your life fell apart after they left you, and you got worse and all these bad things happened? Would you tell you them that you have lived poorly because they were your only reason for being happy? Or would you tell tall tales of how you fought the bad dragons of the world just to make it a better place for their children, for their loved ones, and for yours. Would you tell them that they inspired you to new heights. You did they things they did not get to, and you can tell them what it is like. To do the former is to blame them for their death, and how hurtful is that to someone you loved? To tell them that their death, their inescapable cycle of life, made their loved ones lives in this already inescapable hell we live in, worse.But to do the latter is to truly put them at rest, at peace. knowing that their loved ones have thrived without them, have lived and have known a great amount of joy after the universe has given you your time. That they have made the world better, have made life more fun to live. Or at the least, have a good story to tell. To bring it back, I want to dissect what I feel is the most important part of Seneca's statement, that we should love all our dear ones. We do not know when we will lose them, although if you are losing them because of your actions, you should be well aware of those consequences. So while we share our lives and experiences with them, we should show our love for them. We should share our joys, and try to be better for their sake, if not our own.After all, No one wants to sit at a table and share drugs with the inconsiderate, deceitful, abusive, prideful, greedy, and murderous. I do not think I need to explain why. Live life Loving, and you will love after life",1

Everytime I wanted to become better during those 9 months of getting to know her, I always fail to do so and it hurts my partner emotionally. I am a very bad person, I despise myself. Even though I want to change so badly, so so badly, i just could not and it hurts me a lot. It affects my work, my school, and my hobbies I cannot even do. I feel like there is no hope for me. I feel nothing but pain and sorrow that I am scared that it may affect my parents. I am in so much pain rn and probably forever. I cannot live like this and i know that i needed help but idk. I hate myself and it affects the people that I care about the most.",1

"My [F22] boyfriend [M21] has been struggling with his mental health for years - how can I help him? My boyfriend has been struggling with depression for years. He was on medication in high school but ended up dropping it once moving to uni. His mental health is directly affecting his grades and classes, and the worse he does the worse he feels. He won't see a therapist because he finds them insulting and he /sometimes/ wants to get back on medication, but he doesn't know where to start and ends up running out of energy/motivation. How can I help him? He's sweet and gentle and so so smart, it hurts seeing him like this. I worry so much for him (I have a moderate-severe anxiety disorder) and I just want to make it easier for him. I love him so much.",1

Wanting to at least attempt to get out of it, I tried journaling about my self-attacking thoughts and it turned out to be .. a lot of them. I currently suffer a lot from anxiety attacks due to a very low self-esteem &amp; my financial situation (I'm living paycheck to paycheck without savings) and honestly I just feel down all the time.

I've talked to professionals in the past. However, it lead to nothing because of my own stupid stubbornness. I'm too hard to work with &amp; fix since I just believe I can't change, even though that's bullshit. I can't even start or finish anything, which makes this so hard to go through to fix myself. Honestly, I'm scared to death that I will always feel this way for the rest of my life.

Here're my dark thoughts that I wrote down in just a few minutes. They're a lot.

I'm not even sure why I post this. But I just felt like it, I suppose.

Can anxiety cause this ? A spot that almost constantly itches on my chin and around my mouth under lip? My facial hair even feels more prickly. It seems I am having hypersensitivity to sounds and feel lately as well. I also have bruxism and clench almost all day without paying attention. I had my kidneys and liver all checked out good in November. This started in December. Xanax takes it away yes but if it was something other than anxiety I think Xanax would still take it away.,2
"Have diverticulitis, now anxiety? I was diagnosed with diverticulitis in September.  Unfortunately, the infection spread through a hernia in my groin area and I developed an abscess in my groin.  I was hospitalized for ten days for treatment.  Last time I had been to the hospital was at birth 38 years before, so this was a shock.  I wasn't treated poorly or anything, just being away from my family, from work, from life, seemed to get me down.  I have a five year old and I face time'd with her while in the ER the first night and you could see the fear in her eyes.  She had only been in the hospital prior to visit great aunts, who would go on to pass away.  The look on her face is seared in my head and basically impossible to shake.  A fearful look because I'm sure she thought, when I see people in the hospital, I some times don't see them much longer after that.

It was a bit of a tough recovery, every ache, spasm, etc sent me into a panic.  Feeling my groin to see if I could feel a bulge from a returning abscess.  Pressing my lower abdomen to see if I was in pain from a recurrence of diverticulitis.  Sleepless night staring at my phone on healthline or Mayo Clinic.   Recently, I started having this bubble sensation in the sternum area near my chest, it would come out of nowhere and almost ""pop"" and be gone.  No rapid heartbeat, blood pressure normal, but the more I worried, the more they'd come along, mostly all at night, when my mind has more opportunity to wander.  One night was so bad I did go to the ER, they hooked me to an EKG, did a chest xray, blood tests.  Nothing really, no heart attack.  Was home in bed within a few hours.

My PCP suggested a holter monitor EKG which I wore for a day this week.  No results yet as the doctor has been out, but I'm guessing if it was anything truly pressing I'd have known by now.  I think folks here understand my predicament and I just needed to say it out loud to someone other than my wife.  She herself has had anxiety issues in the past and says it's probably a post traumatic anxiety.

Are these types of sensations normal for those of you who might struggle with health related anxiety?

It hit me hard and I think I am still in denial about it. I spent an entire month working on myself, going to the gym everyday and studying hard. I aced my uni exams and was finally going to start my summer off. I went on a date with a foreign girl on my first day of summer and really liked her. She gave me COVID even though we were both fully vaccinated. Now I have to quarantine in my bedroom for two weeks. I missed a holiday that I was looking forward to all year. The girl will have left the country when I get out. I really have nothing to do right now. Just started my summer and I am focused on my part time job (work from home) and my thesis while my friends are on that holiday. I cannot find any more pleasures in my life. The only time I am happy is when I am at the gym. One hour per day. And football, but that has been closed down for a while and my club has been hit hard financially so I probably will not be re-signed. I am a guy with many interests but get bored of everything easily.

"I have spent the past few months rowing my rickety boat down the black river and into the abyss. I have gone past anger. I have gone past tiredness. I have recently passed bitterness.

I do not even know why I am bothering to post this because it is either going to get lost in the sea of other posts like it, or it will not help me (or both).

Every day, I am either filled with hate or I am totally empty. I have nothing left to give this world and it sure as shit has nothing to give me. Every passion I thought I ever had has been ripped from me because of my apathy towards life. All desire that I have is squashed almost immediately by my complete ineptitude, and I have been at the end of my rope for as long as I can remember. I do not really have a point to this, I just needed to vent, I guess. TL;DR: I feel like I am an artist, but I am trapped by my piece of shit brain and talentless body. I am nobody and I am nothing.

It came to the point that my hearing is slowly decreasing and I would get really really dizzy sometimes but this time my speaker broke so I went back to putting my phone really near my ear and would walk in circles to listen to music and ofcourse it damages it but it is really hard to stop.My life is shit and just a mess. I live in my imaginations and I could only fully feel it when there is music playing. Low volume will not cut it.I am just so sad, everybody in the shows I watch are just going through this exciting adventures and I cannot do anything because of quarantine and because of the limits my family has built around me.I want to stop but I am scared because I know I will not be happy and I will be alone. it will trigger my depression and I will panic and cry. I am starting to slowly change my ways but I guess I just also feel disappointed in myself because I talked about no more regrets and getting myself back together and yet here I am. Ruining my ears for a fantasy. All this weight that my parents keeps throwing at me and this regrets of the past and all those mistakes that matter and do not matter. they are all just killing me. Music is my escape, it takes me to many amazing worlds and I am much more braver and cooler there.I just want to be free and happy. My self damage",1

"Rash? Eczema? Scabies? ? I’m and 18F student and ever since coming to college I’ve had very bad health anxiety, where as soon as any small thing is wrong I’m online 8-10 hours a day trying to diagnose.
My most recent issue is a rash I’ve had on my forearms, wrists, and back of my hands for the past few days. It’s very itchy, mostly at night, and when I scratch I get hive-like spots that sometimes stay, and sometimes go away. I also have little white bumps that are very tiny and don’t show up well in pictures. I’ve been applying hydrocortisone 1% since Saturday night and it’s still happening so today I bought Benadryl cream and made an appt at my universities health services for tomorrow morning. 
After looking online I’ve narrowed it down to hives, eczema, scabies, or maybe ringworm. I think scabies scares me the most. I woke up this morning to myself scratching my wrists like crazy after doing so good not scratching, and then I started hyperventilating because I was so scared because I have read scabies is worst at night. Also, I’ve been feeling itchy around my ears, scalp, and legs but nothing is as itchy or hive like as my wrists.
Overall I don’t really know what else to do as everytime I look at it I freak out and I can’t talk to anyone about it because they laugh when I say it might be scabies or something serious. I feel so stupid. [picture ](https://imgur.com/TBLL4Oc)",2

I don’t know what’s going on I have agoraphobia haven’t left my house in months I sit around all day. I also have depersonalization which caused my agoraphobia. My emotions and feelings are numb and i’m finding it hard to care about anything anymore but lately I have been gaining weight. I’ve put on about 10 pounds in the last couple of months. I weighed myself 8 days ago and today I weighed myself and I weigh 5 pounds more. I am really concerned. what if I have heart failure. I cant go to the doctor because of my agoraphobia (yes it is that bad). I don’t know what to do. I don’t feel good ever and i’m so scared it’s not just anxiety anymore but I physically cannot go to the doctor. I cant even go outside my house without feeling panicked idk what to do. I was already really insecure about my weight but this weight gain is really scaring me. how did I put on that much weight in such a short time. I also had a very vivid dream 2 nights ago that I had brain cancer and now i’m scared that was some sort of sign that something is wrong with me.,2
Hi my name is Pierre I am a 22 year old guy from Houston and for about 7 years I have been really depressed. A lot of people close to me really do not know because I have always been the funny guy that makes people laugh. I have had a tuff coming up me and my mother had a very bad relationship coming up I am not really close to my family but I love them though. I try to keep a smile on everyone is face if I can but at the end of the day I am somewhere questioning why am I alive I have thought about suicide multiple times but I have a niece and nephew that I could not do that too my relationship with my gf is so wierd I really like her but i know deep down she does not care about me its shows but I stay with her I am currently trying to get a car so I can move around without having to ask someone who dislikes me I am actually crying right now my heart is so heavy I can never keep anyone happy I understand men are not supposed to cry but man I just want to be happy and make others happy but it seems I cannot I pray but not as much as I should know I will not get a reply I am not to much worried but I needed to let something is off my chest it hurts sleeping in the bed with someone who is obviously cheating on you and is not interested but before I stayed with her I was homeless and just graduated she knows I do not have anywhere else to live so she treats me like shit because she know I do not have anywhere to go I am so tired of being tired no matter what I do lately the tears have been uncontrollable I need help I am tired I just want to be happy man with peace of mind please God I am so ready to end it all I cannot continue like this Help me,1
"For starters, I am a skinny female with barely any curves, narrow hips, small boobs, thigh gap, small butt and just nothing exciting to look at. Yea, my face is fine but you would be surprised how much a persons body is important. I tried putting on weight, but its very difficult. VERY difficult. I just want to be accepted. It hurts so bad knowing most men only prefer curvy women (which i totally understand, i wish I could have their bodies). I am really praying my metabolism slows, I just went to be a normal weight. Even to gain a simple pound, Id have to eat 3500 calories and even that is a lot of good everyday. At least for meI truly think my body is cursed :/ My body makes me harm myself",1

They are both shit but maybe the weekends hurt a bit more because when I was younger I use to love them especially Saturdays I miss being innocent and not knowing what a shit hole world we live in is. When you are young everything feels exciting and new as you age reality sticks it is ugly head in and everything becomes harder and more painful.l This is where depression makes it is debut and sucker punches you out and then after that you are never the same anymore.

"My opinion is that everyone overestimates what they know about their condition, how their thought patterns work, what triggers their anxiety / depression. This does not get addessed when we introspect, especially when we introspect, in fact the more we feel we know about it, the more the feedback loops get hidden from us. What are some factors / conditions that were addressed / you were informed about during therapy that you were completely unaware about before counselling. What have been some findings / factors of causation / etiological factors that you were introduced / explained about in therapy / counselling and otherwise were totally unaware about or had no idea about?",1
"I am getting a wave of depression yet again and it is keeping me up tonight so I just wanted to talk. Whenever this happens it usually involves self-doubt and loathing, it is so frustrating. I recently graduated from college and this whole transition to adulthood thing is making it exponentially worse. When I talk to my friends about it I just feel like I am constantly burdening them even though they are very supportive. I really love and appreciate them and they are one of the few reasons I am not spiraling out of control. As if depression was not enough, I also suffer from social anxiety (though it has gotten much better than was a few years ago). As you can imagine, that just destroys any bit of personality I have. I provide pretty much little to nothing in conversation between friends and I find it hard to make friends at work or anywhere really since I am so bland and boring. Another problem I have is that my self-hatred really destroys my self-confidence and affects the way I portray myself to other people. It makes me seem less approachable or just not worth approaching. With the frequent waves of depression I have been experiencing lately, I am afraid I am going to start drifting apart from my friends and end up alone. it is just so hard to live feeling like this with these thoughts. I feel like there is a constant pressure on my chest. Now onto some positives about me that I should remind myself about. I am witty and funny once in a while. I get myself up and working when I have to even if I do not want to. I am doing a good job of stepping out of my comfort zone and tackling my social anxiety by working in customer service. I have been putting effort into a hobby I am passionate about and working towards improvement. This is starting to sound like a diary, but I guess that is what my whole account essentially is. Thank you to anyone who took the time to read this and I hope you encounter something that will make you smile today/tonight :) Feel free to reply or comment anything. Just spilling my feelings",1
"I do not want to socialise anymore. I do not want to make friends. I do not want to post online. I do not want to meet anyone new. I do not want to do anything. I just want to disappear into a void of darkness. A dark black hole where my existence is forgotten about while I slowly perish. The pain does not stop, you just learn to live with it. But how much more can I take? that is the real question. People are disappointing. Every new friendship turns me into a doormat of a person, slowly putting up with others uneducated disgusting ways of life. My friends are late all of the time, they do not even tell me that they are late, they just turn up like nothing happened. My friend forgot about our plans the other day. My boss always cancels my shifts because hes not feeling good or too busy to get to work. I get it. People have their own lives and you should put yourself first but that does not mean you should absolutely shit on your friends. I have made some bad decisions in my life. I have done some fucked up things but I am not the same as I used to be. I took time to heal, I took time to sort my life out, which brought my shitty friendship issues to the surface. I spend most days talking to myself in public or at home, pretending that I am a good friend of mine. Its better to be alone than it is lonely in the wrong persons company It does not end.",1

"Decrease stress by ADDING a hormetic stressor into your life. One of the best ways to decrease how much total stress you experience is by adding good forms of stress (short and moderate) called hormetic stressors.  Cold water is a prototypical hormetic stressor.  It releases stress hormones like adrenaline and noradrenaline but it is short and not extreme.   

We just launched an app that provides guided cold showers to make it easy for you to do them.  It is led by a Master Chief Navy SEAL.  We teach you a set of mental tools around tactical breathwort, body relaxation, self talk, etc.  These tools not only make cold showers easier but they also help you handle stress more generally.    

In fact, the best way to train yourself to handle stress better is to systematically stress yourself and then practice these tools while stressed.  If you do that, these tools will become reflexive any time your body generates stress hormones.

One side note - the app is geared generally to men.",3
"I am pretty certain of what is wrong with me. I think. I do not ever say that I have depression. I most likely never will. Until a professional actually diagnosis me I will not. The thing is I will not bring myself to see anyone about it. Expenses, stigma, and pity are all things I have to avoid. I do not want pity. It seems to be a fad to call yourself depressed nowadays. It disgusts me. My father suffered from depression. I found out years later that he was diagnosed with manic depression. He committed suicide on February 6th 2006. After years of guilt and resentment towards myself I have in a way come to terms with what I most likely am. I am my fathers son. He struggled his whole life for me. He lost his battle. I feel like a person like myself would only be doing the world a favor following in his footsteps. He was loved and adored and respected by everyone. I myself have not been good enough for a single person I have met thus far. I would like to be able to explain to the few people in the world that Id be doing something good for once by putting an end to it. Every person I have ever met has eventually walked away from me and when they do their lives have improved immensely. Idk if its hope or fear that has kept me from doing what I want to do. I just do not want to hurt anyone anymore. Even the times when I am happy I still feel like Id be helping the world by leaving it. The reason I have never talked about this is my hatred for pity. I resent people feeling sorry for me. I know I do not deserve it. I just do not want to live like this. Even with medication and a family who loves him my father still could not handle it. What reason do I have. I do not have any questions or inquiries. Guess I just wanted to say what was on my mind for once. Thank you. My dad",1

"I am living with my partner that has depression, we have been together for 6 months. I have never been with someone that has depression and am trying to be supportive, I know that I cannot fix him nor is that what I want to do. I love him and know that his depression is only one part of him and not all of him. But I am not sure how to be supportive in some cases. Like when he sleeps for 20hrs a few days in a row or when he shuts down emotionally. I always let him know that I am here when he is ready but seeing him like that is starting to hurt me. Which makes me want to be more helpful, yet I gather from what I have read and heard from others that is not actually very helpful. We have very open communication and do talk about this, but sometimes he does not know how to answer, which is understandable. I have read books and done heaps of research online about depression and being with someone with depression but I think that hearing others stories and advise would be really helpful.What are things that I can do that support him when he is at his lowest and when he is doing well? I understand that everyone is different but any suggestions or personal experiences would be helpful. Also, any suggestions for my perception of his journey- I do not have depression so I think that sometimes I take his actions and words the wrong way.

"Hi, I am 22(M) and I do not know what depression really is but rn I feel irritated over every fuckin thing, I cannot sleep properly, nothing exciting is happening in my life. Sometimes I wake up at midnight and cannot sleep again even if I am tired. And when I feel like irritated I kind of want to punch myself or throw something in my hand, mainly hurting myself. So what should I do to get back to my happy life? Suggestions.",1

"Hey guys,I have been very recently diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I have been struggling with problems for around 1.5 year, and only now it came to light that it is psychologically, not physical. With my state worsening severely in last 2-3 months, I have noticed something. When I get the attack, I have problems with speech, I talk slowly, struggle with saying/pronouncing certain words/letters. Can anxiety/depression because this during the attack? I have found that this happens to people with a stroke, but I have not had a stroke, all medial tests were negative. Thank you all for any kind of advice, if not allowed, I will delete this post. Can depression/anxiety attack because this?",1

what's bad about it?,0
"I never wanted to stand out, to be the center of attention, to be the leader, but I am always the least interesting person. I always struggle to know if I am a bad person and just do not see it, so I am somewhat annoying, always asking and making sure I am not bothering, or if I did anything wrong. I do not think I am a bad person, but I have nothing to be proud of. My entire life I have seen people be good at this or that, artistic skills, social skills, intelect, etc. I do not want to say it out loud, I think many know what someone want to do when they feel useless and unimportant for their entire life. I am making 23 years on october, and I have felt this way since I was 14, diagnosed with depression at 16. I have come to terms with many pains along these years, I do not see the point on self-harm anymore, I also do not want to have come to this earth just to be a reason of suffering to my parents, my father already told me he would be sad, but he would move on, so not a big encouragement... but I know my mother and 11yo sister (whom I do not live with anymore) would suffer, especially my sister, I think she would be traumatized, so... it is a big anchor to me. But I still cannot stop suffering for not being good enough to be interesting, to be liked, to be admired even, I do not want to be special, just... anything. I usually spend my free time only playing games with a story, watching series and anything media related, listening to music, I feel like my life is some kind of ""hub"" where I can only choose what game/movie/series to experience next. Also, I have read the rules, but I do not know if saying some things may be triggering to others reading, so if I wrote anything wrong, please let me know!&amp;#x200B;TL;DR: I have come to terms with many struggles that comes with depression along 9 years, but what can I do to just ignore this feeling of wanting to be dear, liked and even admired? How can I cope with the fact that I am just another random person?",1
"I don't know how to cope with my grief I dated someone for over 10 years of my life. My entire 20s. I never loved anyone more. We had a falling out, our relationship became toxic and even as we tried to remain friends it didn't work.

I cut her off last year at end of january/beginning of february. I assumed she had moved on and everything and stopped talking to me.

Instead...she died. I suspect she took her own life. No one told me. For 13 months I held resentment towards her. I didn't want to be with her but I was upset that she had made our relationship toxic. 

Instead, she was dead. Her family did not tell me. On tuesday her mother called me to tell me the news 13 months later. I am devastated. She did not deserve to die. I am so fucking angry at myself. I knew she was sick, I knew she was suicidal and I cut her off anyway. I'm angry at her family for denying me the ability to see her funeral. I'm angry that everyone else got a year to grief together and I am dealing with this loss alone.

I didn't message her for an entire year because I was convinced she found someone else and my pride wouldn't allow me to even say ""hi, hope all is well"".

I feel horrendous.",1

"Paranoia and Anxiety about that Brain Eating Amoeba Hi everyone. I'm pretty new to this sub, but I really need to vent.

 I was diagnosed with Illness Anxiety Disorder two years ago and I generally have a pretty good hold of it. Yesterday, I was showering and a drop or two or water got into one nostril in my nose. I could feel it chilling in my nose hair and I immediately used my towel to wipe it out and then I blew my nose when I got out of the shower. However, I live in Florida, and I'm really paranoid that the brain eating amoeba is lurking in the water. This was water from the shower head in my dorm and it has been colder lately, but I can't get these thoughts out of my head. I'm terrified; I'm even tearing up with fear writing this. My birthday is next week and I want to be okay for that and for everything. My mom said I'm worrying needlessly and she's probably right but I can't shake the anxiety.

Edit to add: It doesn't help that symptoms apparently don't develop for 1-9 days after infection, so I'm going to be sitting in my anxiety for days.",2
"List of shit that has happened to me in the past years that have made it an almost unbearable present: \- Parents are in a horrible relationship and have been for their entire marriage but do not have the finances for a divorce. My father has always been verbally and psychologically abusive towards my mum but we were too young and naive to see it. Recently it got to a point of physical violence. Police were called and they took my mum to a shelter but she came back. We would be broke if they divorced as our only source of income is a store which we would have to sell if they did divorce. \- My mother is most definitely depressed maybe due to the afformentioned reasons but I really do not know. I am 17 and yet have the burden of her mental well being because my father could not give two shits and my older brother avoids all talk of emotion at all costs, hence I have to make sure she is okay all the time and be there for her on her bad days. I do not mind this cus I love my mum but I have been getting frusterated recently, causing me to snap at her and feel guilt afterwards. i cannot help someone who does not want to help themselves. \- In addition to all that going on at home, I only really have one friend cus my secondary school friends and I grew apart. I have accquaintances but am scared people I will get to know will think I am pathetic for not really knowing anyone even though its a small town and everybody has their group of friends.\- I just spent the past couple months doing these really important exams that are the entry into medical school but I feel like i completely fucked them up. In order to repeat them I would have to wait until next year. Hence I wasted the entire past academic year. Being a doctor has been my dream since I was a kid and I am seeing it slowly slip away from me. School gives me ridiculous amounts of anxiety and panic attacks cus its the only thing i have left and the only thing that proves I am worthy of something. \- I feel like I cannot talk about any of this with anyone. While my bestfriend tells me how much fun she is having doing one teenager thing or another, I am happy for her but cannot help but see how pathetic my life is in comparison. The only thing keeping me going is hope that things will be better but everything only seems to be getting worse. Everytime i think I have hit my lowest point and I cannot take it anymore, something worse happens and my circumstances get worse once more. I am wasting my teenage years away in anxiety, fear.I do not know what the point of all of this was but I would really really like someone to tell me that things will get better and that there is a chance I can heal from this and find peace in the future. Just kind of fo want someone is outlook, only 17 and have had enough",1

"Eve though my Ex was toxic, she did not use to be like that, before. Only after she became friends with a fucking asshole of a person.

This is just fucking depressing. I am getting dreams with her, every fucking single day.Knowing that I will not find someone like her anymore, just makes me want to kill myself. I know that ""there are many fish in the sea"", but I do not know how true it is, not like her. She had the same personality as me, with so many things in common, that it just breaks my heart. That day, not only did I lose my girlfriend, but I lost my best friend (or at least, one of them).People used to say that we were meant to be together, we were really alike. We had the same lobbies, the same comedy stile, the same fucking everything. THERE WILL NOT BE ANYONE LIKE HER. We loved each other to the maximum. Ever since she left me, I have been so badly hurt, that I cannot cope with the fact that she left me, after months.I have been thinking of suicide, for almost every day. I just cannot keep up with this pain. It is even worse, to go out and see homeless people, I just feel so ungrateful, that I feel even worse. I am so pathetic, that if she asked me to go back with her, I would say yes. The realization that I will never find someone like my ex, just breaks me.",1

"I am so tired.I know in my heart I can fight this. I have done this a million times before. But for what? A few brisk moments where I can lie to myself and pretend it is all okay. But it is not. I am not okay.I do not want to fight anymore. It never changes anyway. Nothing gets better. I do not think it ever will. Whenever I try to fix things they only end up in a worse state than when I began. One of the things I regret is when I do nothing. I vowed to protect them. The little angels who brought me a sliver of hope when I was at my lowest. The ones who gave me a reason to continue on in this cruel world of pain and torment. But I lied. As it turns out, my promises are nothing but empty words and lies. I tried so hard at first, but no matter what I did it was never enough. I am just too scared she is going to hurt me and they have to pay the price. It pains me to know that they are going to grow up the same way as I did just because I am too much of a coward to do anything.Yet another thing that has gone wrong, because of me. I just hope I can help ease the pain as much as possible so they do not end up as much of a pitiful excuse for a human being as me.Its not getting better. Its never going to is it? I am going to be 15 soon. That is If I stay alive for long enough to see that day. I used to tell myself that they needed me. It would be selfish to leave them again. I am still so guilty about the first time I left them. I wonder how many times they cried for me. And all because I was too selfish to stay. But they coped last time. They do not need me. One thing I do not get is why everyone still just blames him. do not they see?!? My other siblings do not remember. Nobody remembers. Nobody knows. I am left to carry the burden of the past all on my own. it is not like I could forget after all. I remember every word, every bruise every tear. I remember everything. I remember the pain and the sorrow and the hope for the future. I remember it all. that is the only thing that is really changed I guess.There is no hope.They make out she was the victim. He stabbed her in the heart and left her for dead while she was the heroine who save the day and soldiered on for her children. What a load of bullshit. I know the truth. I was there and I watched it. The images are ingrained in my memory, the truth like a bullet lodged in my skull. They were both as bad as eachother, a fiendish pair. She is not innocent. I remember when she held me down and made him record me as I screamed and cried and begged her to stop ""restraining me"" as they put it. All I did was talk back. All I did was get upset. All I did. I remember when she threatened to post the footage of me screaming and crying on social media if I did not do as she said. Blackmail was one of their favorite forms of punishment. I REMEMBER IT ALL. I remember when I was three and he held me against the wall by neck shouting in my face, the stench of alcohol on his breath overwhelming. I remember when I told her I was going to kill myself and she called me a coward and told me to wait until the morning because she was too tired and there was nothing she could do, yet when her perfect princess said she was feeling depressed she took her up the hospital. I REMEMBER WHEN THEY BOTH SAT THERE AND IGNORED EVERYTHING MY SISTER DONE. EVERY WORD SHE SAID EVERY BRUISE SHE GAVE ME. I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS FIVE AND I CAME DOWNSTAIRS IN TEARS BECAUSE BOTH OF MY SIBLINGS WERE BULLYING ME AND SHE JUST TOLD ME TO BE HER BIG BRAVE GIRL INSTEAD OF ADRESSING THE ISSUES. I REMEMBER. I REMEMBER. AND OH HOW I WISH I COULD FORGET. ALL I WANTED WAS FOR THEM TO LOVE ME. WHAT DID I DO WRONG?!? WHAT DID I DO!?!I am sorry about that. It just hurts to know that after all of that they get off scot free and I am left in the dust scrambling around trying to find the pieces of myself that they tore up and scattered in the wind. It hurts when they talk about how brave my sister is and how she had it so much worse than us because she was the oldest. How it is all my dad's fault. My sister has a boyfriend who loves her and a generous following on social media. She has money. She could not be happier. My mother met her dream guy. they are about to get married. Where does that leave me? I think you can guess. If I was in the same place they were I would not be going to reddit to write all of this. I would not need to. they have done so much more and caused so much damage and it hurts to know that all I ever did was try to be good. All I ever wanted was to be nice. I did everything they told me to do. I tried so hard. So why am I stuck here and they get their perfect lives? What did I do wrong?If you read this, please help me.

Her mother wanted to have a house-husband for her daughter so that she can take care of her. But my friend denied as it would put more burden on the family which is struggling financially.So her sister got married and went to live with her husband on the condition that her family will pay for her medication as the husband did not do anything. First few months was ok, her in-laws took great care of her. But after that things changed. Her condition worsened. She started coming back to her family, sometimes staying even for months. Seeing all this her mother started blaming my friend for not allowing her to keep a house-husband. Treating her badly. Always shouting &amp; screaming at her. At this point she shouts on her for anything!My friend is preparing for medical entrance exam, she wants to be a vet but all this is hurting her badly.

"Health anxiety makes everyday tasks so difficult Some background about my health anxiety history - I’ve had severe health anxiety intermittently since my teens.  Most often I am preoccupied with my heart.  My heart rate has always jumped up quickly (~180ish bpm) with minimal exercise or even at times of rest, but my resting heart rate is usually 45-55 bpm.  I mention numbers just because my heart rate is a little atypical-but I have been checked out by cardiologists so many times over the past 15 years, always with the reassurance that I am fine. Most recently, this past summer I wore a 30 day holter monitor where they would measure my episodes of high heart rate. They also did a stress test, numerous ekgs, etc. They confirmed I had periods of sinus tachycardia, but it was normal rhythm and said I was healthy.  They said the heart was appropriately responding and was likely beating fast because of anxiety (which I don’t think is the whole story, I think I have a food allergy which can trigger it, but that’s beside the point.). They gave me a low dose of beta blockers to take as needed for comfort/anxiety, but promised I wouldn’t have a heart attack, with or without the pills.  

Anyways, to bring my story to today, I’ve been putting off doing laundry for far too long.  Im embarrassed to admit I have been buying new clothes to prolong my laundry chore. The issue is in my apartment I have to carry my laundry down a few flights of stairs, outside and into another building. After it’s clean I have to carry it again outside and then up a few flights of stairs. The laundry basket is heavy and my heart races so fast when I do this, and I panic. 

I just did a load and I could feel my heart beating out of my chest. I sat down with a glass of water and within 60 seconds my heart rate was back in the 70s. I remind myself that my stress test was normal, even when they brought my heart rate to 190 for several minutes. But I am still so freaked out. I have several more loads to do and I’m so afraid.

I know part of the answer is that I am incredibly out of shape and weak. This is not coincidence -I am extremely avoidant of anything that raises my heart rate , and am terrified of exercising.  I stopped wearing my Fitbit a few months ago (at the urging of my therapist) because I obsessively measured my heart rate and was even afraid of standing up/walking - I believed if my heart rate went above 80 it would trigger a heart attack.  Taking off my Fitbit was one of the scariest things I’ve done but now that it’s been a few months I feel SO much better.  I do my best not to measure heart rate now and have been going on more walks, but lifting anything makes me feel my heart rate and I can’t ignore it.   I just feel so stuck and like I can’t keep up with basic chores.  I feel like a failure of an adult. 

I don’t know what I’m asking for, this is mostly a rant. I’ve been lurking this subreddit for months and it’s brought me a lot of comfort.  Health anxiety is such a difficult illness but this community helps me feel less alone.

TLDR: my health anxiety is about my heart rate/heart attacks. Basic chores like laundry elevate my heart rate and cause panic and avoidance. Feel like I can’t keep up with life. ",2

"it is raining hard here and the frogs are out. One got in the house somehow so I scooped him up. He was a little dry, so I got him a little water to help him out. Not sure if he actually needed it, I suppose when it is not raining frogs are not gona be quite so wet. Anyways, I spent a few minutes going back and forth between holding him and trying to comfort him before letting him go and catching him when he hopped away. I imagine it is hard to be calm in the palm of a giant. Those few moments just felt so much more fulfilling than any time with most people. it is such a simple bond and it is not even reciprocated. But it does not need to be. The frog was probably terrified, how could anything not be in the play of a giant? But all I wanted was to calm it, help get it a little water. I felt bad putting it back outside, knowing the world is even more terrifying for it than it is for me, with predators and dangers. So easily this worry and true care for this frog came, where it comes so much more difficult with people. And it makes me think of the world. Of all the creatures out there struggling so hard just to survive, constantly in fear. it is silly I know to be this upset by a frog. But that simple bond made me realise how I really want a much simpler life. I am tired of working. I am tired of being around people. I do not get that connection with people, I never have. I just want to be free to enjoy those little connections without fear, without worry of going to work to make money or things like that. Without having to interact with people in these complex, almost overwhelming interactions that in the end, I do not know why I even bother with. I do not enjoy them, they bring nothing to me and I doubt they bring anything to anyone else. All this for a frog. Feel more connected to animals than people",1
"I have been working 70-80 hour weeks for the past 10 years. A few months ago I went off with depression and anxiety. I know I am completely burnt out. I get really good days when I am with certain people like my parents or my brother but when its just me and my 7 year old daughter, I feel so down and I am just exhausted with life. Its a struggle to even get up each day and when I do get up, its only to lay on the sofa doing bugger all. My house has become a mess and my daughter, although she says she can see I am happier already, can still see that I am not fixed How long does burn out last, or is this depression? I am seriously considering asking for medication even though I am SO against putting any drugs into my body. I just need a happy pill- or a caffeine cannula! Depressed or burnt out?",1

"I am sorry if you are already going through something and that if what I wrote, brought you down or something but I needed to let things go somewhere and this is the best place for this. Please bear with me, it will be a little long.So, here it goes. There comes a time in life when things just go down and down. You pick yourself up, hopeful for things to get better, you try and work but the end results stays the same and more things get burdened up after that. Like, it has been too long, I break down, then get back up hoping things will finally get better every single day and when you keep doing all this for a long time, you start to get tired and lose hope, but the damn things inside your heart and mind makes you think something will get better only for you to get disappointed again.I am dealing with my problems, I want to focus on them but when you have problems of not only yours but also of your closed ones it gets really tough, you get lost and do not know what to do, how you got into this mess and how you can get out of it. I have had depression for as long as I can remember but it did not affected me much, nut the last 5-6 years have been too much. Ever since I become an adult, I realised how much problems I am around, that are not only mine but of others close to me as well. These are one of the few years of my life that I want focus only on my career but this is just so tough. The things, problems, responsibilities, situation, future, all this has become so much for me to handle I am scared about everything now, 2 days I will be okay and ambitious but something will arise and I will be back to square one. This has been the case as long as I remember, everytime I work to change my life, some uncontrollable shit happens, that breaks me. I try to stay positive, I try to not break down. Apart from this, I feel alone, I have never shared my problems, my situation, stuff I go through with anyone. Although, its not like I have not tried, I did but the thing is no one wants to listen and I do not blame them for this either, nobody wants to listen to that. They will post hundreds of stuff about to talk to them, that they will listen and what not but the thing is nobody wants to listen, no matter what they say. Sometimes, I want that one person that I can talk, that one person with whom when I talk, I forget about all these problems and just be with her, you know. Like, one thing I have always been sure about is that I will take care of that special person for the rest of my life, but have been hurt in relationship and stuff so much that I am afraid of all this now, no girl wants to be with a guy like me, I have seen my crush literally with a person who is rude to her, blames her, treats her like shit than to be with me and they have been together for a long time. I mean, I do not know what is wrong with me or what I do not know. I genuinely care for others and wants the best for others, and I do not care that other people do not want the same for me. But have been hurt so much, in friendship, relationship, what not because of which I have developed several trust issues before opening up, I am scared to open up because I did that easily in the past and fuck, they left or betrayed me as usual but still I do not want to hurt or want anything bad to happen to them. I was even bullied at school for sometime, not physically, and thought about quitting school and taking my life. Now that I am writing this every bad, every damn thing are coming back, that I did not wanted to remember. I lost friends at school, they stopped talking which I afterwards got to know that was because someone was saying different different made up things on my name. Almost every single one of my friend, that I had near my house shifted from here and I ended up losing contact with them as well. I spent a lot of time all by myself that I did not even managed to hold friends at college or forgot the way of maintaining relationships. I was told that some.girls were interested in me during college and at school but the scars and the problems never gave me the courage to move forward and build one relationship with someone special. Sometimes, I See other couples and see how supportive the girls are to their boyfriends and what not and I want that, I want that connection, that feeling of love again in my life but I am afraid that I will mess it up and also, I do not want someone else to go through what I am going through because I know how tough it is but still my stupid mind and heart wants that certain someone who will love me and I will love her. I do not even know what to do or want anyone. I am losing hope again.Btw thank you, if you read it. I am grateful, this was just a rant. I hope you are doing great and your problems fade away and only happiness comes in your life. And sorry for this long, I needed to let things out otherwise my mind was going insane. Sorry I have to let some things out",1

Family How so most of you deal with your families? As the oldest there’s so much responsibility just thrown on me and it sucks. Our dad bailed on us when we were younger so it’s just my mom. For as long as I could remember my life has been nothing but stressful. I’m 22 currently with the youngest siblings I live with being 19. Im the only one with a job and it’s been driving me into an even further hole. My sister has been such a bitch to me lately and I don’t know why. I barely interact with them cause they just always give me suicidal/murderous thoughts. They always have my blood pressure going through the roof and giving me constant headaches. I try to tell my mom about it but she’s under a stern belief that black people cant be depressed and suicidal. It’s only for “white” people as she claims. I can’t afford therapy atm and I just want to leave but I can’t. Any suggestions on what I should do?,1

"I am 33 and have had 2 major depressive episodes since college (where my depression first became an issue). Both episodes followed an almost identical pattern:* **I am doing exceptionally well and my self-esteem is at a high point.**Leading up to the first episode, Id just received my first ever promotion since starting my professional career and Id won a pretty significant local award for my art. Leading up to the second episode, Id just received huge promotion at work and had spent the Covid lockdown on a major self improvement kick. I got into the best shape of my life (visible 6 pack for the 1st time in years!), learned to cook well, did a home teeth whitening kit, bought a bunch of new clothes, etc.* **I meet a girl who I am really attracted to, and we hit things off immediately**In both cases, these were women who I met organically IRL instead of through online dating. We clicked immediately and started spending a lot of 1:1 time together and texting daily. * **I get rejected**The first girl initially accepted my dinner invitation without hesitation, but then texted me a few hours later to say that she was intrigued by me but still had strong feelings for her ex. They did end up getting back together within weeks and dating for a while.The second (current) girl told me that her life was upside down right now. she would just moved across the country to a new city where I was the only person she knew (our parents are friends, but wed only met once before she moved here). She gave me a spiel about how Id be lying if I said I had not thought about it and If you were just someone I met at a bar or on Bumble but that I am literally her emergency contact and the only stable, trusted friend she has here.* **My self esteem plummets from all-time highs to rock bottom**My internal monologue changes overnight from you are crushing it! to a constant stream of You were stupid to think a girl like that would ever want you, you will never be happy, you should just kill yourself (I am not going to, but its an intrusive thought that pops up a lot).All of my friends are getting engaged/married, and buying homes with their significant others, and my dating life pretty much consists of sleeping with women I do not even like just to feel less alone. I just want, more than anything, to be with someone who I am actually excited to be with. The thing that triggers my depressive episodes is also the thing I need if I am ever going to be happy",1

Went to my first survivors of incest mtg yesterday. Sexually abused between 4/5-8/9. Have been crying for the last 3 hours and can’t think of anything else except how lonely and how much of a failure I’ve become.

Then I was forced to disclose to my therapist the truth about the abuse when one of the brothers reached out to me one random day  saying he wanted to perform sexual acts on me.,3

I never used to have social anxiety or anxiety in general but I do now, it was way worse in the beginning and it’s a bit better now fast forwarding 3 years.

Been depressed for too long. Like 10-11 years. All meds make it worse and I am on awful med withdrawal rn. I will never have any relationship in my life because depression kills my brain and any interesting part of me. Ill probably die a virgin too. I am so bored of EVERYTHING I seriously want to be gone. Why cannot euthanasia be legal. Its not fair for me to live like this. Life is constant suffering. I am too scared of death to do it and I have failed suicide but damn I want to be gone Really just want to die,1

"Hantavirus - freaking out - vacuumed large amount of what looked like mouse droppings from engine bay of car. I’m seriously worried right now. Here’s my info. 

Male 
21 yrs old
165 lbs
5’11”
No previous health issues and no medications

I purchased an older vehicle from Alabama (I live in northern Illinois) on March 3rd, 2018. It was shipped that day and arrived March 6th, 2018. On March 25th, 2018 I opened up the engine cover (It is a van) and discovered a large amount of broken nuts or acorns and what looked like mouse droppings (small, round pellets about the size of rice) on top of the engine, along with a few chewed wires. I’m assuming that at some point this van sat for a period of time (not sure if recently before purchase, but I assume not, as there are was no sign of a current infestation to the previous owner prior to purchase). Anyway, fast forward to me cleaning it out a few days ago with a regular household vacuum. I don’t believe I used a respirator (mask) for all of the time, but if I did it was a 3$ one that is made for basic things like sanding, not for chemicals or pathogens. I vacuumed it up for quite awhile, probably about an hr. My question is, am I at risk for hantavirus? It seems that the virus wouldn’t survive after excretion for very long, and assuming that the mice were active until the very day that the van was picked up in Alabama (unlikely), there still would’ve been about 2.5 weeks between then and when I first opened up the engine compartment, and another week or so until I vacuumed it up. Any knowledge or experience with this? Lifespan of hantavirus after excretion? I’m killing my self over this and my anxiety is giving me a bunch of “symptoms”. Thank you in advance! ",2
Not only do I not fully believe in myself but I am also just on the verge of not caring about anything in life except surviving which is pretty sad. Its like a battle between my passion and my depression which makes me not care about much in life. Its 50/50... I wish I could do it already and sign up for nail school and become the nail tech I have always wanted to be. I know I get discouraged sometimes because of my lack of confidence but also the fact that I got to work a 9-5 every single day.. so it would be extra work on top of my full time job. But its definitely a passion of mines I just.. cannot seem to be inspired enough to start already. I hate being this way. Thanks for listening everyone. I want to be self employed but I do not believe in myself,1
"I spend so much time alone, wishing I had friends and could go out and do things with other people, but then whenever I do actually spend time with people I always end up getting blackout drunk and acting like a complete idiot. I woke up today not really remembering what I did last night, just knowing it was bad and I was a fucking mess. I have woken up so many times with this same feeling. I am plagued with anxiety about all the nights of my life I have sketchy memories of. How did I get home? Did I do something bad? Was something bad done to me? Why am I bleeding? Did I sprain my ankle? Was I flirting with that girl/guy? Did I try to kiss them? That sort of thing. Stupid decisions (if you can call them that...) after too much booze that I will spend the rest of my life worrying about and ruminating over. I should have learned better by now, but on the rare occasion that someone invites me to do doing something social it is always the pub, and one drink to calm my nerves about being outside in the world soon turns into one too many and me crying or falling over or trying to kiss someone I am not even attracted to just to feel something.The solution is surely to stop drinking, right? I wish it was that easy. I wish this drunken idiocy was my biggest problem but it is just one way of ""coping"" with the depressed, anxious, lonely existence my life has become. I hate myself. I hate everything I am and everything I have done. And I hate everyone else too, and society and the world as a whole. I have been suicidal on-and-off for over a decade. I try to convince myself to keep going but experiences like this just remind me that I am not meant for this life and it is not meant for me. I do not have any friends, and when people try to be my friend I either ghost them or do something to piss them off while intoxicated, because I cannot soxialize sober. I am so done",1

Just myself. I have heard the saying every teenager goes through a phase like I am going through hundreds of times since I tried to let people know what I am going through mentally. No one believes me. I lost my faith in god since he never helped me out when I needed it. I do not believe in an afterlife anymore. what is wrong with me?

"How can i best support my friend? ((throwaway because a common friend follows my main account))

Some brief background info:
I have autism so I may not always understand all social cues. Neither my friend nor I live in the US.

I have a friend going through a hard time right now. He has depression and recently has been experiencing all sorts of physcial issues. He's had depression before I even met him and have never seen him this low. He also has money problems and thus can't afford treatment for his physical issues atm. 

What's the best way to support him?
I cannot support him financially since i also have almost no money.
 Whenever i talk to him he gives short and/or snappy answers and is generally in a bad mood. Whenever I talk about positive things, it feels preachy or that I'm ""rubbing happiness in his face"". Whenever i try to talk about neutral things  (basically small talk) the conversation dies off. So he's understandably a bit difficult to talk to as of late.

I admit, it's difficult and hurtful at times but I just want to know what would be the best way to provide my support. 

 Any and all clarifying questions are welcome, I just want to provide the best support I can.",1

Hi guys, so today, I forgot to wear gloves when taking out the trash, and when I took out the trash, I saw squirrel feces, we have a lot of squirrels here. So when I threw the trash away, I accidentally closed it on my hands with cuts. Now my finger with cuts is itching very much.

Could it have been rabies saliva on trash cans, and now it got into my hand from the trash can. This is our homes trash can which is outside our house. Am I overreacting and overthinking something I should not? Thank you",2

Anyway, so we were roommates in a super tiny apartment that didn’t even have a living room, just our two bedrooms divided by a kitchen. He was having some issues with his ex-girlfriend so he was venting to me for hours about it, and I was trying to give him as much advice as I could, because he’s my friend and I care about him. I told him this and he said he cares about me too, and then he started telling me that when he first met me, he was attracted to me but that I was too young so he felt weird.",0

"Everyone has their own lives and it is dumb of me to expect people to remember when they have said they will do something for me....but is it really that bad of me to expect people to remember me? I asked my roommate last week if he would drive me to a biopsy I had this morning, and he had come back super late the night before and was asleep when I needed him. My sister who has been helping me with my car payments had said she would be able to help me with the payment today, and we even talked about it yesterday and still, she forgot. I hate being a burden and I hate asking for help, so even ASKING these things of them is so fucking hard in the first place....having to remind them is even worse. I ended up just driving myself to my biopsy because I did not want to bother my roommate by asking him if it was still OK. I do not want to bother my sister about the money even though the payment will bounce and I will be charged an extra 100 in late fees because of it. Its literally so humiliating asking for help, especially when it comes to money, and reminding people that they said they would help is even worse. I really think I would just be better off letting the cancer take its course so I do not have to bother anyone anymore. I really really REALLY hate this. I wish people remembered me",1

"Last year, during the UK lockdown, was the very first time I have ever wanted to die. It got so extreme that I came off of the internet for a few days to try to heal. I did not know what caused it. I will probably never find out. But i did heal...slightly. After about 3 days I realised that I did not want to die and my suicidal thoughts were gone almost instantly but the depression was not. I have spent a year feeling nothing but numbness, guilt and anger. Nothing else. I have had to force a laugh for a year. At one point, I tried to reach out for help but because of covid, no one was there for me in school or in the community. And now I have slipped back into my depression it is numb, but it is emotionally draining. I have had to force myself to write (which is the only hobby I can peruse because my other ones are social hobbies) to which I just think 'what is the point?"". I cannot look at my body without feeling sick of the sight. it is hard to get out of bed but when I do, I just sit there and wait. there is nothing to do. Nothing to wait for. Getting in showers or baths has become so difficult that I have resorted to making a timetable of when I need to shower. I cannot be bothered pretending anymore. I am not okay.I cannot reach out for help. My parents will think I am faking it. My friends could not care in the slightest. I do not go back to school until August (which I am dreading). I do not have anyone to turn to. In all honesty, I could not name one person that I would be able to go to for help. I do not want to die but I do not see the point in living. This is a rant more than anything. This is not a sob story. I am sure quite a few people have gone through this same experience. I can just feel myself go downhill with every passing day. I have not felt raw joy since I do not know when. I cannot remember. The numbness is almost like an uncomfortable calmness and I cannot shake myself out of it. I am self destructing again",1

"Is the stress of my international sales job worth the benefits? Looking for guidance….. Hi,

I’m a sales director who recently received a promotion to build and lead a new sales operation for an Australian media company in a foreign country. After relocating my family and settling into our new home, I found the job to be manageable, albeit stressful, for the first 8-9 months.

However, after a year, I've realized that the stress has become a part of my daily routine, and it's starting to change my personality. I'm experiencing burnout, feeling completely drained, unmotivated, and even depressed at times. I report to upper management located overseas who may not fully understand the realities of building a new operation in a foreign country. Despite being expected to do more with less, the results are still expected.

I'm struggling to decide if I should push through this or throw in the towel. On one hand, the benefits of international experience, such as building and managing a team in a new market and exploring new commercial initiatives, are invaluable. On the other hand, the stress is taking its toll, and I'm not sure if it's worth it.

I would appreciate any advice from those who have been in similar situations or know someone who has. It can be quite isolating, and I lack a trusted network of experienced expats to turn to for guidance. Thank you in advance for your help.",3

"Scared to ask mom for things because of judgement 
Ok so kinda a weird post, and I’m not sure if it belongs here, but I figured this sub was probably the best one for it. I also tried the social anxiety sub, but my post was instantly removed. So basically I have this huge fear of asking my mom for things because I think she will judge me for them. I don’t have this fear around anyone else (I couldn’t care less what anyone else thinks of me) but for some reason I have it with her. I’m not talking about little things like asking for something at the store or asking for basically any necessity. I’m talking about bigger things like hair dye, piercings, or really anything to do with clothing. For example, recently I worked up the confident to ask her over text if I could dye my hair, which she is fine with, however later that day when she asked me to show her pictures of what I want, I chickened out and got to scared to show her.  It’s like I knew she would say yes, but I was still to scared to show her because I was afraid she’d say something judgmental to me. She has always been sorta judgmental towards me but  I really want to get over this fear because it prevents me from getting a lot of the things I really want. Is there anything I can do?",2

"Due to a bad childhood, horrible socializing skills as a kid, and other things in between, I fucking suck at emotionally connecting to anyone. I do not have any attachments to my family, since my bad childhood mostly involves them. I only have 4 close friends, and they are amazing ones, but I have only really connected to and opened up to 1. I could easily relate to her and we could talk for hours on end. We took a few month break for her to focus on her mental health. Now that were talking again, it just feels like we lack the connection we use to have. I still cherish her and everything, but sometimes it just feels one sided, but I cannot blame her. She recently got a lot of new friends and just has a busy life in general. My 3 other friends, while close, I have only opened up to one and that was ages ago. When I did, his parents saw my messages, told the school principal who then proceeded to call my mom, which made some issues for me. Ever since then, the only person I have opened up to is the friend I mentioned first. I have talked to her about some of my issues, but I do not want to burden her. She already feels guilty for not being there during our break. My last 2 remaining friends, its hard to open up to since I have never talked to them about this stuff at all, at least on my side. The best thing about the emotional connection I had with my friend originally, was that it made me feel happy unlike anything else. It made me feel like I was living. I still feel that way when we have a fun time with each other or have a good convo, but now its just a double edge sword to me, with the sad feelings that come with it. I do not have anyone else to rely on, to relate to, or anyone there for me. I do not think me and her will ever go back to way that we were before, and that scares me. I would have no connections then. I would just be a sack of flesh walking on this earth. Suicidal ideas have came back. I know I am a wimp when it comes to this stuff, I could not self harm even if I wanted to, but maybe the cowardice will run out sometime soon. Until then, I have time to brainstorm lots of ideas I wish I could Have More Emotional Connections",1

"I am 17 and my little sister is 10 years old. When we were younger we were two peas in a pod. I love her more than anything. Our relationship took a turn for the worst my freshmen yearly high school. The year before my parents had gotten divorced and it really took a toll on me mentally. It did not help that soon after my parents got divorced my mom made us move into her boyfriends house right away (I still see my dad often). To this day I cannot say I am fully okay. But my little sister was not really bothered by the divorce. In fact she loved my moms new boyfriend and I was mad at her for it. I cannot explain why and that is not really the point of this post anyways. Sometime into my sophomore year things got really bad between my mom and her boyfriend. They started hitting each other, breaking things, and often times my moms boyfriend would storm out of the house leaving my little brother and sister to go and comfort my mom. My sister even slept with my mom sometimes. Things got so bad my mom and her bf from up and we moved houses and this is where my sister began to not be okay. My mom and her bf spend a couple months apart but it did not take long for them to get back together. We moved back in with her bf at the end of my junior year and now I am a senior. I noticed that something was right with my sister so I sat down with her in her room to talk. She bursted out crying when I asked her if she just wanted her big sister back to talk to her. Our relationship is slowly building up and we are slowly getting back to where we were. But today while I was doing my sisters hair I noticed she would not look at herself in the mirror when I asked her to put her head up she looked straight at the ceiling. Later while I was doing her hair still she began crying and she still will not tell me what is wrong. I am begging my mom to take my sister to therapy but she is a piece of garbage and at this point I might as well be the mom of my siblings. Please help me idk what to do.

I will obsess and fixate on completely mundane things. For example: If I overhear someone taking about a movie but I don’t know what the movie is, I may fixate on “Who did they say the lead was? An Australian named Ben. What was the movie? What was the movie???” and my heart will start racing and my breathing will get shallow and I’ll need to get up and walk around. 
Another example might be for me to see a photo of myself reading and I’ll obsess, wanting to figure out what the title of the book is that I’m reading. 
I might also obsess wondering what a logo on a shirt is, who was that guy that I helped with a flat tire that seemed so familiar, etc.

In response, he told me that I was sensitive and that is why we cannot have these conversations, and I that I am not a real man anyways. That last part really hurt my feelings because I am a pre-T trans guy and I have a hard time getting people to see me as a male. After that I told him to go fuck himself and I hung up on him. I know what he said was wrong but hes my only friend and I cannot help but feel like I ruined everything. Might have just lost my only friend.",1

"We couldn’t have Thanksgiving because of money struggles in the family. I am here begging and pleading for help to get some food in our cupboards to help hold us over as long as we can. I’m counting down the days until tax season so we can fill up the pantry! We receive about $700 each year from the Wisconsin Homestead Tax Credit which is what we use to catch up on bills, prescriptions, and to stock up on food.

Looking for perspective I (F18) have been given the diagnosis of GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) and it has taken an extraordinary toll on my physical health. I am in a constant state of fight or flight and I’ve never been in this much pain in my life. It’s the kind of pain people kill themselves from. I am constantly shaking and throwing up. This constant stress has given me the diagnosis of IBS (irritable bowel syndrome). I had to go to multiple doctors as IBS is hard to diagnose. The stomach pain triggers the anxiety and the anxiety triggers the stomach pain so basically I’m constantly in both mental and physical pain. However I believe it goes deeper than GAD. It doesn’t stop. It’s not attacks either it doesn’t come or go.. it stays. I’ve taken benzos and they don’t do shit for me and neither does any depression or anxiety medications. I wish I could be sedated so I don’t have to be awake and in pain. There have been a few incidents where I had to go to the hospital and beg to be sedated or at least booty juiced or something that would put me to sleep. Luckily I found lamictal and it has saved my life. I honestly don’t think I would be alive today if it hadn’t been for modern medicine. But this still raises the question of what is actually wrong with me. I’m thinking of this because my lamictal is beginning to lose its effect and I have to increase my dose every couple of weeks. I couldn’t get a therapy appointment scheduled until late June so I’m kinda fucked.,2

"I feel bad for being this depressed Honestly, I've been faking being ""ok"" for a while.

I've been in some low places but this is in the top three for the lowest points I've had. My youngest sibling died by suicide in November of 2022.  So I do realize the pain suicide causes but damn when you get into that place, it's neat impossible to get out of.

I have plenty of things to keep me going. Like my nieces and nephews. I do want to watch them grow up, and be a guide for them, but I really am struggling with not wanting to exist anymore. The antidepressants I'm on aren't working. My doctor is *very* aware they aren't, given she knows I've had dreams of suicide recently. Yet my medications just got added on to. I'm just tired. I want to give up. Even though I know I shouldn't.",1

"can someone tell me its really difficult to get diabetes? Hey,

I have been very anxious about possibly having diabetes for a while now. I am a bit overweight and dont exercise often. My eyesight has been declining over the past years and my family has no history of diabetes. so there is nothing to be alarmed about. However i keep thinking i have it, every little sign makes me freak out. A few days ago I found some mold in my toilet and immediately assumed it was because of the glucose in my urine or something. 

Can someone please give me some positive assuration or facts about the odds of getting diabetes due to being overweight? I think if I get told that you dont just develop diabetes for no reason, my anxiety would decline a lot. ",2

"Constantly “checking” for signs of brain problem Hey, guys. So this is a little difficult to explain, so hopefully I can describe it as cohesively as possible. So, a couple months ago I developed a little obsession with misreading things. I misread a couple of words and immediately began to think “there is something wrong with my brain”. Well now, it’s manifested itself in just about everything. In a bizarre way to prove I do/don’t have a problem, I’ve begun subconsciously “checking” every thing I read and hear to see if I made a mistake. For instance, I’ll skim a headline really fast online, then get frustrated when I misread it (even though I didn’t carefully read it). Because I’m now “checking” every single word I read and hear, I’m constantly misreading, mishearing and misunderstanding things, because I’m focusing on each individual word and not the sentence as a whole. It’s mentally exhausting and is effecting my reasoning skills and memory, which of course, is fueling my health anxiety as it further “proves” I have something wrong with me. 

Of course, occupying my mind with this causes me to make many, many mistakes which- you guessed it- fuels it more. 

Has anyone else struggled with health anxiety pertaining to a brain problem? This really sucks. ",2

"Sorry, I am unsure if this is the right subreddit to post. I already know I have all the goods: severe depression, adhd, anxiety, you name it. But today, after like 50 hours put into a game, something happened that caused me to waste/lose at least two hours worth of progress and it immediately made me lose interest and motivation to keep going. This happens all the time to me, in the sense of a small thing leading me into loss of a feeling of having something to do, loss of motivation, and then boredom that melts into depression. Where I then end up sitting around all day in bored, unable to convince myself to even bother trying another game (my only comfort hobby I have) or even get up. I hate feeling like this over small inconveniences, and I just do not know what I can do to get out of the funk until I find a new thing to hyper fixate on and distract me from being bored/depressed.

I have never done therapy before so I have no prior experience and do not know if its just a me thing or if I need to try another therapist. I have decided to give it time. I think I am depressed, I do not know if for a fact I am, but since I was in middle school I remember myself feeling miserable and sad constantly. I want to stop this inner bully from ruining my life. Still, I keep pretending to be optimistic in my sessions with my therapist and she keeps telling me she does not think I am depressed. I always agree with her and reassure her that I also do not think so. Wtf? I do not know what to do.. The obvious answer is I need to open up to her, but how? I feel judged even with the person I am supposed to let in. hey you all",1
"I am such a retarded fuck up, you know what I am tired of hearing? I am tired of hearing my school counsellor or my soccer coach telling me shit like 'it is in your head', 'Get out of your own head' and the most useless of all 'Combat/Challenge those negative thoughts'. Surely, one would think, if they were capable of basic human tasks, i.e. Not fucking up everything you do, the most basic of tasks in a sport, or talking to people, or giving people eye contact for god's sake, you would not **need** to **artificially** boost yourself esteem. Because you **are** capable of those things, you are capable of functioning as a social-able human. You know how fucked my self-esteem is? Sometimes, well actually, most of the time, I hate having a fucking shower because I hate seeing my disgusting retarded fucking body in the mirror. Despite being told by some that I am too skinny, or that I am normal, etc etc. I still feel and I still am a fat fucking retarded loser. I do pretty decent at school, I got an estimated ATAR of \~84 for Year 12. I wanted to be a pilot in the RAAF, but how the fuck am I ever going to achieve that if I am just an autistic bumbling piece of shit retard who cannot have a conversation with their mates one on one. I can do speeches to a class, or hell, even the school fine; but when it comes to talking to someone or having a conversation, I just cannot. I literally want to kill myself as an escape. I remember early 2019 (I think), I was plus-oned (since I never get invited to parties, not even my own friends') to a girl's party who I somewhat had a crush on (if you would even call it that, I do not think I had ever spoken to her, even to this day). Being the socially inept fuckwit that I am, I practically held on for mercy to my friend group as it slowly deteriorated as they spoke to other guys, and women who they did or did not know at the party. Eventually I was all alone, kind of just awkwardly sitting on my phone in the corner while everyone was having fun in the pool. You want to know what I was thinking while everyone was exploring their teenage lives with girls or having fun with their mates? I thought about I could smash my skull on the edge of the pool hard enough so that I would knock myself out and drown, or how I wish, how I begged that I had a gun and could just shoot myself in the fucking head. I eventually had the nerve to walk out on the party while some of my mates asked where I was going, or that they did not want me to leave. Staying at that party would have done far more harm then good I estimate, in fact I **know** it would have made me more depressed on the walk home then I already was going to be as I walked home. Why cannot I just be normal like everyone else, is it because I am an only child who spent 90% of his childhood staring at the wall or watching TV on his own because no one was ever home? Is it because I was a fat little fucker throughout the entirety of primary school, and how being picked on for being a fat cunt has subconsciously impacted by self-esteem? Or was it that time in 2019 when I got completely dacked doing a pullup on the oval infront of the entire fucking school? (I was already a social anxiety-having fucking retard back then.) Holy shit typing this just feels good man, wow. Do I have asperges? I do not fucking know. Do I have social anxiety? I do not know. Am I just shy? I do not know. Do I have depression? I do not know. I hope I do not but I kind of hope I do at the same time so I have a reason to be so mentally fucking defective. All I know is that I have fantasized about killing myself since I was a 10 year old, and NoFap has merely granted me more time to think about how badly I just want to kill myself. How bad I just want to buy a gun, or join the army and just shoot myself in the fucking skull and just obliterate my existence from this Earth. On that note, I am not like most people who say they have ""Given up on humanity"" and how they are ""turning their back on humanity"". Because I am not angry at society or humanity, I know I am the issue, I am the defect. I am so lonely and I love this solace, this hole that I am in, this melancholy. It feels warm, cozy, it feels like I belong here and it feels like I am here to stay. I do not give a fuck anymore, I just want to die. Maybe I will regret it when I do kill myself one day. I am just so tired of being an autistic little fuckup loser. Sometimes when I get mad at myself or I feel stress, I just like to rant in my head how I am so much a fucking fat little cunt f\*ggot fucking loser, it feels good. Sometimes I like to pretend I am holding a gun to my head (or in my mouth) with my hand and just pretend I am pulling the trigger and that I will not be here anymore. I remember when I was a little younger, I used to go sleep, making a prayer (Eastern Orthodox) and just pray that god will kill me or end my life. I am just listing my thoughts here so if this feels a little disjointed, I apologise. I just wish I could be normal, I wish I did not hate the very existence of my being, my body, my stupid ugly fucking face. I wish I could look people in the eye while I talk to them. I wish I could talk to people. I wish I could talk to girls, I wish I could feel **not** lonely. I have done research on how to do those things, and it just brings me back to where I started. 'it is in your head', 'Get out of your own head' and the most useless of all 'Combat/Challenge those negative thoughts'. Just read that, kind of liked how I brought it full circle. I know other stuff about helping my social anxiety and stuff, people say just talk to people or talk to strangers, even just shallow talk etc. and it will get easier. Sure maybe it might, but I do not want to have to try man, I am so fucking sick of having to strive to be average instead of just 'being average'. I do not want to try, I just want to kill myself and not have to bother, just give up. Some of you reading that message above might be a bit smug and say, 'then do it, nothing is stopping you, just do it, you are just going to be another statistic.' Do you really think I care about being another statistic? If I had a gun, I would have already killed myself lmao. I would probably be dead in the pool or on the couch, I do not fucking know. I am listening to some Radiohead and just writing these things while putting on a good album of their just feels right. I will wrap it up here, how the fuck are people cocky? How are people arrogant or become overconfident? I want that shit man, surely it is better than every thought you have in your brain is either a plea for suicide or a neutral thought which manifests itself into a negative one. Anyways, that is all I can think of for now in my smug retarded essay. Comment what you guys think or something so I know my block of text did not go unnoticed. Or even advice, I dunno, I have not **totally** given up yet. Thanks guys. Self Esteem - Kind of just listing things to get off my chest",1

"I am over everything in my life. I just moved in with my best friend too be closer to a different job. I moved out of my apartment and moved in with my best friend because both it was closer to a new job, but also because that i felt that apartment represented a horrible part of my life, one where I put the barrel of my gun in my mouth 26 times but could not pull the trigger. But now I think that was a mistake. We were really close before, her kids adore me and her husband got along with me. But over time, I have damaged a lot of that relationship because of my mental illnesses and I think she resents me, possibly hates me and the only reason she let me stay here was because her kids like me and she feels guilty because of how much I have helped them monetarily over the past couple of years, even though I have never asked for a dime back and do not care about the money. But everything since I began moving in last week, up through now says she does not want me here, and now I cannot afford to move anywhere else. My depression is probably more fucked right now as I am writing this than it ever was in my apartment.

"I'm sick and tired of this bullshit I can't tell anyone else so I'll say it here

I have no particular circumstantial problems, traumas etc in life, yet I feel like absolute shit. I feel like I'm cutting myself just to shoehorn myself into a community and feel like I have a problem, so that I can blame all my shortcomings and failures on that ""mY dEpReSsIoN"" instead of owning them up like a normal functioning adult and improving. But noooooo I waste everything I have, all the resources at my disposal, and its funny because I actually am disposing them down the drain lmao. I am just acting things out in this elaborate drama I have constructed for myself so that I can feel like a victim of my own imagination, make up problems where there aren't any, and poach resources away from those actually suffering. 

You know I sometimes take a blade to my hand but I get scared. I get terrified, that probably is a primal instinct. That definitely means I am faking it all, right. If I really hated myself and wanted to kms, I'd be able to sink it deeper, with no regards to the pain. But noooo, all I can do is barely see the white.  Because if I was really wanted to kms, I'd have something to show for it. If I'm really suffering, I should've been able to cut deeper just to deal with the ""emotional pain"" that I apparently have. But wait, I can't slide-and-dice deeper - if everything in my life is all fine and dandy, yeah that's right. I'm a fraud. I can't, so that clearly shows I'm not in pain. can't even get a drop out. I'm a fucking fraud 

How do people do it. Deal with the pain and just slice away down deeper. I wanna be able to do it. I'm fake as fuck.

"Does anyone get health anxiety about a loved one or pet? I can’t live like this. I have everything I’ve ever wanted and all I am is constantly scared to lose it. My mom got breast cancer this year. It was caught early and is hopefully treatable. But it’s sent my already anxious mind into a tailspin!!!! I can’t stop reading sad stories and looking over at the love of my life, laying in bed next to me, and imagining him withering away of cancer. I freak out if he has a headache (or myself). Ask him to check his testicles all the time. I’m trying so hard to live in the moment because I’m so scared of the mortality of life but it’s causing me to panic about living in the moment.

"I will try to keep this relatively brief if I can. I am suffering. I was diagnosed with ""Severe depression with suicidal tendencies and PTSD"" when I was 12 years old. I received treatment and things went generally smoothly up until this year. I have joined the military 3 years ago and this job has absolutely stressed me beyond anything I could have imagined. I started having severe depressive episodes to the point where I have come extremely close to killing myself multiple times for years. On top of that, I am in charge of a specific section with only one person in it besides me so with the workload, my own extreme loneliness, and not being able to take a vacation for more than a week, I am at my lowest point of my life. I have tried so hard to make things better with myself by working out and getting in better shape, going out with my work friends more, and taking time for myself...but nothing is working for me anymore. I just go home and lay down on the couch to watch YouTube and TV and just wallow in pain. I no longer take care of myself, just enough to not raise any suspicions about me at work. I lie so much to everyone that I have a great life when in reality I am a fucking failure with no luck in terms of romance, sex, friendships, being a good brother/son/uncle, and a good leader. I feel like my empathy has died because I am starting to notice that I only really care for babies and animals, not even my family I can empathize with anymore. I sleep about 2 hours at night, I barely eat anymore, I barely work out, and I barely leave my house besides for food. I have turned to binge drinking just so I can feel some sort of happiness because being alone with my thoughts in painful. I cannot cry anymore and all I feel is constant anxiety, stress, and this seething rage that just never goes away. My family has a history of mental illness and I hypothesize that I might have Bipolar 1, but I cannot get it diagnosed. Because of my status as a military member, I cannot get it diagnosed because I know that I will get kicked out for it being a ""Psychotic mood disorder"". I know it is best to get some professional help because if my supervisors and family knew how badly I wanted to kill myself, it would more than likely ruin my life and reputation. I am trying to hold out til next year when I officially get out and can move away and move on to a better job, but I do not know if I can hold out anymore. I still have hope that things will get better but that light is starting to fade and I am seriously contemplating just ending my life before I ever really had a chance to live it.

I want to find peace and just live a normal life....a better life than the one I have only seemed to ever know. My heart hurts so much and I really do wish to get better, but I do not know if I ever will. I do not even know where to start to change myself.

Compulsively giving myself anxiety? Recently I just stand doing nothing and then my body gives me anxiety? Like... I used to remember things and get anxious but this time even moving my eyes gives me anxiety? Feels like fear of having that feeling causes that feeling. A sudden sharp pain in chest.

"Taking NSAIDs with an SSRI I know that taking an NSAID with an SSRI is not advised. But given that, do any of you still take something like ibuprofen or naproxen anyway? I’m not asking because I plan to use the comments as a permission slip for me to do the same. I’m going to ask my doctors and work with them.

I suffer from back pain, and naproxen is super effective for me. I’d like to restart Zoloft, but I’m concerned about the impact on my health when used with an NSAID. I have a couple of doc visits scheduled to see what they can do for me, and if there is any way I can do this safely or with minimal risk.

But in the meantime, I’m curious what your experience is. Does your doc make you do blood work every so often while you take an NSAID? Did they put you on a different med? Do you just stick it out during pain and not take those types of drugs? Do you do physical therapy? Etc?

I’m aware there are other pain meds out there, such as Tylenol, but I’m asking specifically about NSAIDs due to their anti-inflammatory effects.",1

This January I got a middle ear infection from a flu or cold and after antibiotic treatment it went away and now I'm having pressure on my other ear that feels just the same and I'm worried its another ear infection. I've been googling non stop and I don't know what to do. I've been googling people who lost their hearing and are completely depressed and HIV related to sinus issues because I still have a runny nose all the time and maybe I'm undiagnosed for it. I'm worried that what if my immune system is failing because i have HIV, or cancer. Is this called stress... I don't know what is normal because I've been on edge for years now and I'm scared.

I don't know what to do. I go normal for a few days then in a state of panic for another month. Is this HIV should I be worried? What if its another ear infection I don't want to go deaf and be depressed for it !

One day I felt very anxious and bit fidgety. Yesterday, I felt really good I was energised and upbeat. Started to do things I loved before depression. But today I feel so down again.

"My therapist has me journaling my childhood, with an emphasis on connecting my recollection of events to my emotions about myself. This has been a painful process, thus far. I am discovering a lot of problems with my parents that I have been making excuses for. But this recent revelation, that my dad did not ever really care for me, it fucking hurts. I always told myself he was too busy, or too tired, or I was too annoying, or too loud, or any number of other things. The only time my dad showed any interest in me was when I wanted to play a sport. And even then, it was only to the point of talking about the sport. Never anything more. How am I supposed to come to terms with that? I cannot really confront him about it, he is going into the latter stages of Huntington's Chorea. He cannot really communicate well or clearly. My mom already passed away, so I cannot ask her about it. Is there anything I can do to process this? Digging through my past, with my therapist. I am realizing my dad never really cared about me.

"I think I'm losing my mind Hello guys, long time lurker here. I've seen earlier a post about colon cancer anxiety so I decided to blow off some steam by telling my story.

It all started last summer, when I had a weird pain in my left abdominal area. Went to my GP, said it was nothing but that I should have a blood test (I was 20 at the time). I found out I had an important Calcium deficiency and after I took some supplements the pain disappeared. 

Fast forward to last week: that pain came back, exactly in the same spot. Now I'm going once or sometimes even twice a day, compared to my usual routine of once in two days. The pain fades away after bowel movements and that put me at ease for a couple of days, but today I saw in a stool some dark-brownish spots which I believed to be blood.

This has gone too far. I have no idea what I should do, but I want to get out from this dumb situation. I don't enjoy life the way I used to because of some stupid thoughts.",2

Especially being from a poor country where piracy is the only way to consume things, I had literally any movie, game, book, tv show, comic etc... at my fingertips, available in 1 second.

But it is definitely taken a lot of magic out of life. Consuming so much for so long made nothing interesting anymore.

"I’m dating someone I really like and it’s absolutely killing me A bit of background: I was diagnosed with ocd and gad about 15 years ago. Been very much under control for the most part. 

I’m 32 years old and just started dating an incredible 31 year old woman about a month ago. I’ve dated a lot over the past few years, but this is the first time in ages where I’ve REALLY been into the person. Normally it feels like the people I date like me more than I like them, and anxiety doesn’t play a role. I just go about my day with a calm mind and do what needs to be done. But now it feels like the roles are reversed, and I’m getting crushed. 

Constant thoughts of whether or not she likes me, obsessing over every word in her texts to try interpreting meaning, freaking out if she’s doesn’t respond to my messages within a couple hours. It’s taking over my life. My work is slipping, I can’t sleep well, a constant awful sick panicked feeling in the pit of my stomach. 

It doesn’t help that she’s very reticent with her emotions and does not offer much words of affection or validation. But I don’t want to scare her off with my intense feelings so on the surface I’ve been playing it cool the best I can. I almost wish she would just end things with me so I could move on, because not knowing how she feels is the worst part.

I don’t know what to do.",2

I feel so guilty that I missed six months with them just to wallow in my own sadness. I am not going to do that again, I cannot. Thanks for reading I guess, this was a bit of a emotion dump.

"Its just a dice roll on how I am going to feel that day, its either good, meh, or terrible, and I am having a lot less of the good and more of the meh, but no matter how I feel that day the thoughts of insignificance, life having no meaning, not knowing what I want to do with my life, feeling like I am wasting my life are always there. I fucking hate it, I know life can be beautiful and fun and Its not like I do not experience that and enjoy the day to day now and then but most of the time I just feel crushed and defeated and lost and hopeless. Its just the same thing day in and day out and I do not have the motivation or drive to do anything other than sit around and watch tv. My interests, hobbies, passions are all still there I just do not have the motivation to care for them, sometimes they feel boring even when I wanted to do them. Not wanting to exist is just a normal for me now, but even that feels wrong, I know I want to be here and get better but sometimes it does not even feel like the depression it just feels like waking up to the shitty reality of the world. Every means of survival has been monetized, working an 8hour desk job is the only way to feasibly survive for 99% of people, the state of the country is shit, the state of the world is shit, the world might not even be livable in 100 years. I just want to be able to wake up with something to live for besides the possibility of it all getting better because that is the only thing keeping me moving. I do not know how long I have been living with whatever form of mental illness I have got going on but last October is when it started getting bad and now its unbearable. And I hate to say this decline happened during Covid because it feels like it invalidates how I am feeling, you know everyone is going through the same thing, its just the pandemic, and all of the other BS. I hate the way I feel but do not know what to do to change it",1
"lived in Vermont apartment for over a year, possibly with dangerous radon levels I'm a 28-year-old male, reasonably fit, moved to Montpelier, VT over a year ago. Yesterday at work I overheard two women talking about a tunnel that was cordoned off due to dangerously high radon levels. I did some research, and apparently Montpelier is a death zone with abnormally high levels all across, with the average being a whopping 3.4.

I'm an introvert and spend a lot of time indoors, horribly afraid of cancer and now I'm convinced I'm going to develop lung cancer. Haven't had the radon levels in my apartment checked, and I can't afford a contractor to do the job right. I heard the free test kits require around nine months to get an accurate reading, and I refuse to wait that long and potentially jeopardizing my health. I have a shitload of work to do and I can't concentrate. I don't feel safe in my house anymore. Is one year of exposure to potentially elevated radon levels enough to develop lung cancer?",2

"Played an old song ""I do not cry when my dog runs away, I do not get angry at the bills I have to pay.""I did not feel anything, I did not cry, I was locked inside my mind, feeling a cold apathy.""I do not get mad when my mom smokes pot, hits the bottle then goes straight back to the rock.""My mother was a bipolar drug addict, she committed suicide during my childhood.

I would have two big plates, four enchiladas, two tubs full of beans, eight tortillas, family meals, bags full bread from various food chains, whatever spoiled thing was in my fridge E.T.C. And I would be eating this way for a long time, going deeper into mental illness, without even seeing it. I would just sit there in cry. did not even know who I was anymore, I had faced derealization that would last for so long I had a difficult time stepping out. Long days, fast years.I was endlessly spinning in a downward spiral.Then I played that song, and I realized how full circle my depression is. I have went through so much since that point, life and depression has changed much, but I have slipped right back into everything I was when I loved this song. Full circle depression",1
"Intense bought of health anxiety for the first time in quite a while. I recently started on an SSRI and have been doing fairly well for the past few weeks; thoughts related to my health anxiety are present but I have been able to drive the worries away quickly. This morning was different.

I had just woken up and was laying in bed when I had a random thought; my chest feels fairly still. Normally I'm very aware of my heartbeat--due to anxiety, I think. I place my hand over my chest and realize I can't feel my heartbeat. I check my wrist and I can't feel it, either. I immediately get sent into a panic attack and jump up and start pacing furiously, hand over my chest. Now, logically, I know that if my pulse has stopped, I wouldn't be able to jump up, pace around, etc.--however, I just can't shake that sense of impending doom. When pacing, I can feel my fluttering heartbeat, but now when I'm sitting down again I can't feel it. I made the mistake of looking up why I might not be able to feel my pulse and read that a weak pulse is considered a medical emergency, so now I'm absolutely paralyzed with fear. 

Has anyone had any experience with this? Am I in real danger, or is this my over-active brain sending me into a panic over nothing at all?

"My troubles began when I confronted her about withdrawing large and frequent amounts of cash from her account and asked her what she was spending all that money on when she wasn't paying for my siblings.

I'm freaking out Yesterday I was hanging out with my buddy things haven't been good for either of us. I told him how two people that I knew died this week and my great aunt tested positive for cancerous cells . His birthday is coming up and he saw how depressed I was and wanted to smoke weed with me. I haven't smoked weed in a while and said screw it we were smoking I went to the bathroom I come out and find out his mom took a hit. Now I didn't know this and I know they smoke together my HA has been under control but unfortunately Now my mind is running all over the place panicking worrying about diseases. Now I'm not saying they have diseases I can't stop worrying about it. For example we were using a bowl and a bong we were passing to each other now I'm worrying about shit like Hepatitis or HIV and stuff like that. Again I'm not saying they have because when I did smoke with them before I was perfectly fine but my HA won't stop me from over thinking and going worst case scenario.,2

"Actually you're a total badass Most people are mentally and emotionally sane, relatively at least. They might claim that the worry is all in your head, not understanding that your corporeal experience strongly suggests otherwise. They might tell you to think positive, because they don't have an inner voice that constantly gets drowned out by a huge stadium packed with negative objectors. They might take it rather personally when socializing is the very least thing you want to do, they could never imagine that them yapping on about their normal life drains your already depleted life-energy. Some of them might start all kinds of shit with you because they see you as a weak and opportune victim to unload their own shit towards, never realizing they're the real cowards.

Some of them might truly want to help you out and tell you get therapy asap, then you might see some random bureaucrat person completely devoid of empathy struggling to stay awake while you pour you heart of desperately looking for some kind of assistance. Assistance that usually comes in form of dubious drugs that only work at a hefty price by the way So they advice you to go see some private expensive experts, unaware of the fact that your wallets suffers with you. They like to imply that you just chill the f out and relax. Because they don't have that intrusive, horrible, horrible, horrible, encompassing, joy-devouring, soul-obliterating, sucking, painful, torturous, uneasy pit of dread stuck right in their stomach with racing thoughts to boot. Perhaps they'll make sly remarks on how you need to just grow up, after all, they don't know how's it's like to think like an adult while emotionally reacting like a little fragile child scared to death.

They might say go the gym or be physically active and get some endorphins running. To be fair, is actually solid advice if you can muster the strength to go there. Off course they have their problems too, the difference however is that your problem is you and how that you contaminate every aspect of your life. The point is, according to some of 'them' you're just a loser, useless, lazy, afraid, a waste of space, a failure with nothing to show for in life. They are so much better than you and intentionally or not they make you buy their version of you.

However. It's just opinions from judgemental people at the end of the day. I don't want to you to waste any energy on harboring any resentment, envy or anger towards anybody, they just don't understand. How could they know the truth. Perhaps even you don't the truth about yourself, so I'm going to say it, just in case.

You simply being here and keeping on makes you a tough as nails. A warrior that fights hordes of demons every day. Bravery is defined by the will to face fear, you have fear stuffed in your face all the time. You may suffer endless anxiety, but you as a matter of fact are courageous by the definition of the word. Doing your best to just keep going, that's it. It's not some lofty motivational speech, just a cold fact.

It may not help you any bit to read this, but I for one will not let it be unsaid. Anxiety is bad enough in itself, so rather than feeling shame in addition you have earned the right to have pride in yourself. My intention is for you to keep that in mind on your darkest days, because I know very well what it's like to suffer anxiety while having your character measured by factors out of your control.",2

"21M. So. I have been feeling depressed, very anxious and very low the past while. I grew up in a abusive household until I was 18, I moved in with my sister for 3 years and that turned toxic and it did not work out (she was angry, hatred, thinks she still hates me), I moved into student accommodation yesterday and I am still overwhelmed and depressed. I have been like this I was a little kid. but what is happened over the past few days just made me feel so low.My family were basically just my brother and sister. My sister now thinks I am backstabbing her for leaving. I tried to explain but she got over sensitive and angry, it is for the best. We were living in a 1 bedroom small flat. She was annoyed and unhappy over time. So I decided to leave, but she was not having any of it.So I got the bus an hour away from home to student accommodation. I got off the bus, ran to the bathroom and took a panic attack. I was there for 45 mins. Left walked round town and checked in to the accomodation. did not eat anything just spent most of the day annoyed and crying. So I was sitting for hours last night and this morning just anxiously looking to click that 'call' button on the support line. I explained my situation. They asked questions, asked about my GP and I agreed to have another assessment. They said it was a suicide line, but I have dark feelings, I feel hopeless alot, pretty much every day since I was no age. But I could not bring myself to end it, I just want the pain to end.It felt ok taking the first step. I know I needed help for years. I do not know what to do with the sister situation. I am still very low. But if anyone else is feeling low or suicidal. If this quiet, socially anxious weirdo like me can do it, anyone of you can I rung a support group",1

"Why do I feel weak and sick all the time? Freaking out for a month now. Bloodwork/uralysis results: https://imgur.com/a/divyBwV

**Please click on the images and expand them before claiming they are too blurry to read.  Thank you.**

Bilirubin was elevated, but he said it was just Gilbert's syndrome?  He is my new family doctor (Canada).  Old family doctor would have done all sorts of clinical examination (feeling abdomen for things, listening to abdomen with stethoscope, neurological testing etc.), but new doctor barely looks at me.

Daily fatigue began last March, improved somewhat in September, then worsened again in January.  I've been experiencing the following symptoms for the past month+:

* Muscle weakness - hands and legs feel shaky and uncoordinated, worried I'm going to drop glasses when I pick them up to drink, legs shake while I'm walking up and down stairs, etc.  Worsens with exertion.
* Left hand feels weaker than right, and sometimes has pins and needles sensation.
* Extreme drowsiness
* Brain fog
* Flushing in legs, chest, head, and what feels like rapid temperature fluctuations from cold to warm.
* Lower left abdominal pain and discomfort.
* Nausea and dizziness
* Feel very hungry much of the time, often shortly after eating.  Gnawing feeling of hunger.
* Seem to never gain weight despite eating 4 meals a day.
* Mild urine retention due to tight bladder neck (began 2+ years ago, diagnosed via cystoscopy in November)
* Infrequent sharp pain near anus/rectum
* Very twitchy eyelids - Initially it was only my right eyelid, but now my left eyelid twitches as well as eyebrow and upper cheek on right side.

Stool is mostly normal, but:

* Undigested bits of food in stool
* Feel like bowels aren't completely voided, but can't push the rest out.  Feeling goes away after wiping.
* Stool sometimes broken up into large chunks instead of one long stool
* Stool sometimes thin and stringy

Symptoms can be up and down, but mostly down, and seem to correlate with food on some level, although I can't figure out any meaningful pattern.  I am unsure which symptoms are connected and which are not.  The fatigue and weakness worsens with exertion, even just going for walks, making exercise difficult.  

I am a 30 year old male.  I weigh 120-125lbs, and height is 5""6.  I haven't had alcohol in over 4 years, and I've never been a heavy drinker.  I eat reasonably healthy meals, and still maintain a reasonably high appetite in spite of these symptoms.

Most distressing symptom by far is the fatigue and weakness.  Can barely keep eyes open sometimes, and it can feel like I'm tied to a ball and chain.

I had an ultrasound and liver workup, in addition to the bloodwork above, which were apparently normal.

Doctor believes I have somatic issues related to anxiety and refuses to do additional testing or refer me to any specialist.  I cannot find a new doctor, because there is an extremely long waiting list for family doctors.  While I begged him for more investigation he practically sat there laughing at me and told me to go find another doctor if I wasn't happy.

I am worried, and my quality of life is suffering.  Should I just keep going to the hospital until they agree to investigate?  What should I do?",2

"Convinced myself I have Celiac disease? I've been lactose intolerant since I was 20, and got diagosed with GERD as a child. However I just recently did a dumb thing and looked up symptoms of celiac disease and am rationalizing going to the doctor and getting tested.

No one else in my family, even extended, has had lactose or acid problems. Eating gluten with celiacs long term can cause those problems. I've always been underweight (5'11, 130 lbs). Im also always tired, though I think my iron levels are fine and I cleared a thyroid test a few years ago. When I have more than 3 drinks in a night, I have severe vomiting the next day to the point I've gone to the ER because it had been every hour, for 8ish hours.

For someone this anxious about it, you'd think I'd track these things better. But now I'm locked into a very shitty vegetarian diet at work chock-full of products with gluten for the next 5 months. Would I be justified in going to the doctor just to lay all this out there and see if its related, maybe to celiac? Or am I just being paranoid?",2

"When can we celebrate victory and rejoice? 26M. Met my first panic attack mid-August 2018. The next five month that followed were hard and you all know how it feels.

I do remember there was a period in October and November when anxiety went away. I was happy, but happy too early, it came back knocking on my brain’s door last month. I do remember the frustration I felt because of that.

The most recent anxiety episode was on the 4th of January. I’ve been feeling well for almost 2 weeks now. I do get anxiety-typical bodily symptoms, but I have been better at ignoring or noticing very little of that. The ‘what if?...’ thing is still in my head, but I try to reassure myself it’s not logical.

My question is, when can one be sure his anxieties disappeared and are not likely to reoccur? It’s been a ‘too-good-to-be-true-twelve-anxiety-free-days’, but is this the case to celebrate a victory yet?",2
"Ever since my father passed when I was 12 I have been depressed. I am 24 now and sometimes do not even think I am depressed until a random photograph catches my eye or an old song comes on. The weirdest things can throw me into a spiral where all I can think about for days is death, but then Ill be completely okay again for long periods of time. I also have unrelated personal issues I am working through, and when I get depressed I do not even necessarily only think about my dad. Ill read random local obituaries and google the names on memorial plaques and just kind of go into this weird way of thinking where my thoughts are more emotion than words. Tonight is one of those nights. I was at a lovely park with my mom and little brothers today and saw a memorial bench, as usual I googled the names and discovered the story of a 26 year old man who died of cancer, but not before the grief of that tragedy causes his 23 year old sister to take her own life weeks before he passed. Is it normal to feel okay for weeks or even months at a time?",1
"I really dont know what to do anymore For the record i am not suicidal but i do feel like i have no way out of this. I have a concerning health condition that has been neglected for the past 6 years and gradually getting worse. I am on a slow decline in health and will do a more detailed write-up of my life and issues soon. I see death as an option to free my body of its ailments and the stupidity that caused it, had i not hurt myself i would be taking a different path but im pretty much disabled now and have tried to fight the healthcare system with no diagnosis and been labelled as crazy by every person i meet. I wont sing, dance, look or feel the same way again so for me thats not worth it. I always dreamt of doing those things but now i will never be able to do them efficiently. I dont see death as a bad thing, just terrifying and really hard to process and a way to get out of a shitty life, i would rather die than be in a lot of situations really because we all die anyway i dont really want to suffer for too long. And the world doesnt care because it will just keep spinning. so there arent any negative feelings just logical and impartial situation which i accept. Everyone will die too so rather sooner than later. Otherwise I would have a degree in performing arts or music by now and would be performing and doing things with my life. Sadly that isnt the case and am stuck with an illness that isn't getting better.

My face is swollen and so is my body, my wounds won't heal, I can't exercise and feel fatigued every day, my veins bulge and I have extremely pale skin, my eyes are also bulging(my brother pointed this out to me and I thought I was the only one who thought this), my teeth are cracking and my gums are pale, numbness in every single part of my body, blood pools, anhedonia, and dissociation, impaired memory and I can't even count or decide what to eat, have to double check my spelling and memory and even then I forget, bathroom struggles, insomnia, weak bones, head feels full and swollen, fingernails have started to club believe it or not, hair and nails don't grow, blue extremities and struggling to breathe, cant hold head up and body feels very heavy to carry, sharp pains around my body aching pains, blurred vision and double vision, i can't even walk anymore and my ligaments crack all the time. pre 2017 this would not have been the case because i injured myself very severly and do not realise the damage i have done. doctors are saying nothings wrong with me but thats not true, the problems have built up over time which i suspect is a problem with my vascular system but getting seen in the UK is very hard. i have also bought a healthcare plan which is not private health insurance but all that i can afford(£11 monthly). The extent of damage it has done to me made me realize that i may not ever be normal again IF i ever get treated that is, and so i feel like my only option is to die. I know some people say that people who are crippled and have disabilities can have long satisfying lives but that is not the life for me, especially considering there was nothing wrong with me before. i always dream to be that way again but i know i won't get that anymore and i wont be happy at all, the damage it has done to me probably affected my brain to the point where i dont think it will ever recover, or my heart, or my bones, or my optic nerves so i don't think it's worth living if I have long-lasting complications.

And also the cause was self-harm, I know it sounds silly but it could have been prevented. I was mentally ill and the things I did weren't normal, looking back at it now and it's all my parent's fault, they convoluted my idea of normal since I was a little kid. I never got the help i needed not even for my selective mutism and now I'm screwed for good. I'm no good anymore and worthless, I can't even make or remember memories and this isn't the depression speaking since I had an urge to fix my life and get back on track. Now I have a wound that will never heal. My parents were extremely toxic and detrimental since my youth, my only fantasies were ones of running away. I don't have much contact with them and am stuck in the house with them. In 2017 I self-harmed so bad my left side went number and weaker and I have been that way ever since. Now it's caused so many problems because of something pressing on my vascular system causing harm to my entire body, but I am told there is nothing wrong with me, even by the most toxic people of all (my parents) they got so sick of me trying to reach out for help, my father shouted at me and sent me into a burst of tears, I choked on my tea but I persisted and called the doctor and asked for an appointment, he took me to the docs but I feel like I'm in a losing game. I don't really have any positive options anymore and am in so much pain 24/7. I've lost my sight somewhat, hearing, function, mobility, emotions, and cognition and am basically becoming a vegetable. Even if I do get treated it will be too late as the damage has left permanent wounds. I've shown someone pics before and they have admitted its pretty messed up what I have been through. I am struggling for answers but at the least, I can get a diagnosis just so I can shove it in people's faces and prove them wrong. But other than that I just don't know what to do with my life anymore. I got tired from making this post I took a few breaks and am still lethargic.

My doctor that i recently visited also noticed that i was looking a bit pale so for me thats been a relief, he was quite attentive and offered to give me a blood test which is next month so i have to struggle to next month. He weighed me(im 48kg now) and we talked about my symptoms and I did mention to him it has to do with my vascular system, it's now a test of time to see what will happen. Realistically I don't think my prognosis is too good. But people are becoming more attentive to how messed up my body is so I think thats a good but far too little too late now",1

"I have been trying to get a therapist but my insurance is bad and the one place I could find was South Jersey Behavioral Health. do not go here. It has taken them a total of four months to get an appointment. They do not pick up the phone and the message box is full. I had to go there in person in May to fill out papers since they do not pick up, wait a month for an intake call, wait a week for a call to set up a real appointment, and when they did not call I go back there in person (again, no picking up phone). Secretaries are just shooting shit with each other and not busy. I ask her to make me an appointment and she says the next appointment is mid August. I asked why it takes so long to get an appointment, she says they are booked. Really, bitch? You guys do not look busy here at all. I just told them I will be taking my business elsewhere (like there is anywhere else), and to go fuck themselves. I came home and filed a complaint to the Better Business Bureau. it is just to give them info; I am not taking legal action.TLDR: Doctors hate me for no reason and no one cares about my mental health. I reported behavioral health place to BBB",1

"At what age did your HA start? I have always been a bit uneasy about medical problems, but didn’t start feeling physical symptoms until about a week and a half ago. With no triggers or life circumstances to speak of, my brain started telling me I need to take deeper breaths than I am capable of taking. The next day I hyperventilated so hard that my hands went numb and curled up tight. I am 24 and until recently I figured I had managed to evade young adult mental illness. Most people I know had it start at a much younger age.  Any other late bloomers here?",2
"Can anxiety cause bi-polar like symptoms? I go through periods of feeling happy, like everything is fine and I’ll be ok. But then something small happens and I feel like my world is ending, everything is wrong, everyone hates me, etc. The highs and lows can be extreme, but I’ve seen therapist and they have told me I’m not bipolar. Could this be a form of anxiety?",2

"How do we know that it is SVT rather than VTach? Very rarely, I will have these 5 to 10-minute episode of sudden high heart rate, above 180. I learned that this is may be SVT.  I have already seen a cardiologist and she did all sorts of tests and concluded my heart is structurally normal and there is no worry. But no test has ever been able to catch these rare ""racing heart"" issue of mine. I have had these since I was a kid, decades ago. And I do have them every couple of months or sometimes there will be 1 or 2 years between ""attacks"". No other symptoms except the racing heart which feels like it's ""lightly beating"" so fast (I once counted up to 200+ bpm). On Holter the ""worst"" they caught was a few isolated PACs.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I have been reading about VTach and this seems to be dangerous kind of arrythmia because there is a chance if can go to Vfib. Yeah, we anxiety sufferers are a hypochondriac bunch.

&amp;#x200B;

So how do I know what I have all along is NOT VT? Now I am so afraid to be left alone and so afraid of those attacks whereas before I learned about VT, I did not mind them too much as my cardiologist assured me I am okay. But now, I am always thinking what if these are SUSTAINED VT rather than a more benign tachycardia??",2

"My whole body is aching like i have the flu I don't know why all of a sudden after almost a week of no symptoms, now my body decides to flip the switch and start all over again...

Yesterday i thought i'm having a heart attack because my left arm was aching all week and then yesterday and even today i had chest pain.

Now it started that my other arm is aching too and my whole body just feels like i have the flu or something. 

Even my mouth feels spicy and weird...

I don't know, is this really something anxiety can do?

I don't feel sick at all, but everything hurts like i'm in full on flu mode.

Pretty much everyone on my mothers side of the family has rheumatism, maybe it's finaly breaking out for me?

Has anyone else felt like you usually do when you are just completely flu struck, only that you aren't actually sick?

Today was the first time i took a magnesium supplement (187 mg) so maybe it has something to do with that?",2

I was born being choked by my own umbilical cord. Probably should have died then.You suggested therapy but there is no way I am going and it will not help, how do you help someone just born feeling this way? The only thing they do is give you drugs to mask the pain and i took those for years and was a literal zombie.

"Probably is not the right subreddit to post this in but I just want opinions.What should I do with myself?Should I enlist in the military?I know some people are automatically going to say yes but I want some honest opinions.Basically I am 23 years old and I feel completely lost in life. I am still living with my parents, I am working as a janitor at a school, I have a useless college degree, I have never had a girlfriend or been on any dates. Even though I am young I just feel like I am already failing miserably. I frequently consider suicide as a serious solution. I was going to enlist in the military right out of high school. However, I took four years of HS JROTC and absolutely hated it. My experience with ROTC ruined my view of the military and I decided not to join. Now here I am five years later and I am not sure what to do.Now here is my other issue. I have very bad anxiety. Like I live in a constant state of anxiety and I am pretty sure I have depression because I actively consider suicide frequently. I get stressed out very easily and I feel very stupid because I frequently misinterpret simple instructions (which honestly might just be anxiety setting me off in the wrong direction but still). I am also not physically fit in any capacity, I can hardly perform push ups. I only recently started considering enlisting again because some people have told me that joining the military helped them a lot with their lives and I am just wanting some honest opinions on if anyone thinks I should join or if I should figure something else out.

tw terrorism death amp x 00b i f australia have crippling anxiety surrounding flying and i really want to figure out how to deal with it i didn t know the root cause of this fear until i wa about or so when i wa having a conversation with my parent during this conversation they casually brought up the fact that they had let me watch 9 on the news i wa at the time including all the footage of the moment the plane hit the twin tower people jumping out the recording of people saying goodbye to their loved one and so on for two week after apparently all i would say wa plane go boom despite not remembering any of this it check out a i ve always had a very deep seeded fear of flying for a long a i can remember and i wa clearly just a tad traumatised by this i do remember being a child and always cry in not wanting to go on family holiday because i wa convinced there were bomb on the plane and would be looking under my seat and so on searching the last time i went on a plane wa when i wa for a family holiday where i wa admittedly a massive brat and refused to do any of the activity during the week because i wa so upset that i wa being forced to take mere domestic flight and just wanted to go home because of my ability to now refuse to step on a plane a an adult i have only been to two other country near australia which were all during my childhood it is not lost on me that this is still a very very very privileged position to be in and that there are far worse thing in life than not being well travelled however i would really like to get over my fear of flying because since it is impeding on my life for me my biggest hang up over flying is perhaps the lack of control associated with it i m at the whim of the pilot and the plane i know statistically i m more likely to die in just about any other way but i think what make me not have a crippling phobia of anything else is that i probably delude myself into thinking i have more control in those other situation eg if i get into a train crash or something i have more of a chance of surviving by kicking a window out or someone else dragging me out and often activity like driving are just necessary for going about daily life so i can justify the risk however flying isn t some absolute necessity so i have a far harder time justifying it and am completely distraught over the idea of dying just because i wanted to go on some silly holiday i wa intending to do some travel this year since i ve graduated university and thought i had managed my fear i am supremely grateful that money isn t an issue for me so i m more than happy to spend more on flight with safe airline like qantas for me not to have a complete breakdown mid flight and figured a lot of my anxiety could hopefully be managed through that but the latest china eastern situation ha sent me into a spiral and i m not doing great obviously can t compare it to what the poor victim and their loved one are experiencing i tried to stay away from it but i accidentally saw the still of the plane vertically diving and i nearly threw up i had quite similar reaction to other plane crash in my lifetime and they completely derail my life for week afterwards because i get so upset from it i apologise for how long this post is just a bit of a mess at the moment and have achieved absolutely nothing today except writing this post i m just not really sure where to go from here but am open to any suggestion thank you so much for your comment in advance i genuinely really appreciate it,1

I have had sleeping problems for years, but it was never TOO crippling, just falling asleep would take me 2-3 hours sometimes, so ""only some"" time wasted, but I would usually temporarily fix it every few weeks. But For the past 4 or 5 months it got so bad that most of my time was spent in bed, falling asleep would take 4/5 hours and sometimes I would not even get any sleep at all, at times 2 nights in a row, and during the day I would feel like a zombie. And absolutely no method worked. Tried meditation, exercises, changing my diet, meds, drugs, even getting drunk to sleep where I typically never drink. Would have completely botched my university semester if not for online lessons and cheating on exams like crazy. Fixing the sleep schedule was my main goal for those past months and since a week ago I actually did it. Regularly going to sleep and waking up at consistent hours for 6-8 hours of sleep. Problem is, I still feel just as tired and lethargic. Starting to suspect it is really just the stress and me being unable to deal with insecurities and past traumas. Everything I do either fails or frustrates and tires me. I would often draw to relax and try working on creating my own video game since it is been my dream for years but I am absolutely unable to focus on either. I do not even have anyone to talk to about it. My family never understood me and we are on bad terms for some years anyway. The friends I have had for years are only called friends because I dislike the word ""buddies"". Recently I got closer to a group of people online who I care for deeply and do my best to support when they have it hard, but I realized it is not a mutual feeling and whenever I would bring up some of my issues they would often get dismissed or met with a ""lol"" or the attention would go to someone else mentioning their problem. At this point I do not really care though. I just want to be able to focus on stuff I am doing. I am sick of wasting time doing nothing. I tried various non-prescription meds to help concentrate but nothing works and when I would ask a doc to give me strong stuff (back when I was looking for sleeping pills or the like) he would refuse, saying that I will only get addicted and ruin my health. My passions and pastimes no longer give me any joy and I cannot do them. Can medicine help? What kind? What to do?",1

"Trigger warning anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughtsI have struggled with depression and anxiety all of my life. But a few months ago I did a 6 week group therapy course and I was feeling much better. I started slimming world, I started going to the gym, I just started enjoying life again. I have to have hormone injections every month to put me through menopause at age 29 and soon I will be having surgery to remove my final ovary because of endometriosis. The last 4 weeks or so I have felt absolutely amazing, I have had a positive outlook on life, I have been going out and doing things and actually having a life. Then I realized last week that I had missed my previous hormone injection, I do not know how long for. So last week I went to the doctors and had it done, and since then the darkness has been rolling in and slowly suffocating me. And now I am terrified that when I have my surgery I will be in this dark place constantly because I will be menopausal and because of my health issues I cannot take HRT. I have pain in my chest, I am constantly fighting panic attacks, I am not bathing or even changing my clothes some days. I am trying to eat right so that I can hold on to something that has made me happy but the urge to binge eat is constant. I am fighting it but it is just so hard.I have to walk my dog once a day and I am sat here paralyzed by anxiety, not wanting to leave the house. Like there is something pinning me in place. I want to cry all the time, I am picking fights with my husband over trivial things. I just feel like I am drowning.I want to speak to my doctor about changing my medications but I am too scared to pick up the phone. Plus even if I could I sleep 12 hours a night and I often miss the chance to even make an appointment.I have been suicidal in the past when the darkness takes over and I am not there yet but I am terrified it is just around the corner.

But the longing for connections makes me make bad decisions in my wish for connection and intimacy.  It all feels like too much. If I didn't have work I feel like I would just sleep all the time. Even the things that used to help, playing video games, reading, watching movies and shows bring me less and less joy as time moves on. Sometimes I'm even angry that I was born at all. Not that I've never had happy moments but they get lost in the sea of depression. So, here I float on these waters with no land in sight.",1

"Driving Anxiety Hi everyone, I wanted to just put a note here to see if this is a common symptom people experience (even with medication).

Ever since 2020, I developed severe anxiety that seemed to arise behind the wheel. It started with little things; I would hit a bump and would spend a little longer looking in the rear view mirror than I ordinarily would. 

Eventually, it escalated to the point where I would compulsively circle blocks or pull over just to make sure that these bumps and potholes were not pedestrians. And if I did circle a block, usually there would be OTHER potholes or bumps, which would lead to a mental downward spiral that drove me, quite literally, to insanity. It was one of these spirals that led to my first trip for psychiatric evaluation.

After beginning medication, this generally subsided to a manageable level, and with CBT I was doing pretty good. Then, in December of 2022, my wife and I were stopped at a red light when us and two other vehicles were completely totalled by an F350 who rear ended us, travelling at roughly 80 KMh. He ran from the incident. Everyone was miraculously not seriously injured, but I’ve been set back to pre medication levels of anxiety while driving. 

This hyper-vigilance (I drive quite a bit) has now lead to significant physical illness for me. From stress, I’ve ground my molars to completely flat, and the tension within my body from being so, braced? I guess? And overly vigilant while driving, is really locking me up. I’ve gained a lot of weight, too. It’s lead to serious depression as I’ve built a life that requires me to have a limber body.

Does anyone have any similar stories to share? Or even just some relevant encouragement… I’m really getting to the end of my rope lately because of this.

Thank you beautiful humans, please drive safe and treat yourself gently.",2

"Am I Depressed Without Realizing I’m Depressed? Okay this may seem like a dumb question to a lot of you but just hear me out and please keep the judgement to a minimum. I'm sharing this because I genuinely want to change for the better after living like this for 20 years.

For a little background, I grew up in a household where my mother and I weren't on the best terms and all she did as I grew up was work occasionally and sleep in bed all day long. Microwave dinners were a regular thing for me and my brothers, I did pretty bad in school blah blah blah. The big thing was, I was never taught good hygiene as a kid. It was never required or encouraged enforced. I grew up and went through high school without showering regularly, doing assignments, or even engaging with many people outside of school because my mom didn't allow me to get out of the house much. I'd spend my time, playing games, reading, and a loooot of media. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't a weird smelly kid in highschool (surprisingly with the whole shower thing. I didn't sweat or anything and always used deodorant and perfume clean clothes etc.) I had a lot of friends that I talked to daily up until senior year. My senior year was when Covid hit and everyone was in quarantine. When school started back up I never went because it was online. That same year I moved in with a new bf and his dad and uncle and since I was so accustomed to staying in a room all day without socializing or doing anything, that's what I did there. I dropped out of highschool and lived with my new boyfriend at the time for two years and to this I realized that I still never leave the room I stay in. Even when my bf has a job that requires him to travel for work, I stay in the hotel room still having horrible hygiene habits (although again not smelling bad or anything) and consuming lots of media from the bed. I'd have moments where come to the realization that l've spent days, weeks, then months doing the exact same thing and wasting the entire day away doing absolutely nothing. It's only dawned on me now that something could be wrong and I should hear other's opinions on it. Of course I'm using a throw away because sharing this is embarrassing enough. I've never considered myself depressed and honestly I never want to but every time Hook up what l'm dealing with su*cide and help websites pop up...

I don't know how to go about this and I genuinely want to do better, so if anyone knows some steps I can take to doing better, I'd really appreciate it.
I've been like this my entire life because it's just how grew up but don't want to waste away any longer.",1

"Cancer testing tomorrow I’m currently 17(male)and I’ve been having so terrible anxiety about cancer for a week
I’ve had pain in my lower left abdomen and haven’t been able to defecate, also I’ve been having pain around my neck and the feeling of tightness around it aswell,my dad is a doctor so he ordered some testing for me, he does not think I have cancer but after the testing comes back that’s when I can have peace in my mind
Hopefully all goes well",2

"Why don’t I get help (more of a vent than anything but yeah) I don’t know what’s wrong with me I don’t know if this is the right place for this I’ve never been diagnosed but I’ve always been stuck with this feeling of nothingness I want to die but I don’t and it comes in waves one day I’m fine but the next I can barely get out of bed I don’t bother to get help even though I feel like I need it I think maybe I just wouldn’t know where to start or really imagine myself to be truly happy with anything 
I have always resented the thought of maybe I’m depressed because it feels like that’s become the norm every person and their dog brags or says they’re ‘so depressed’ and I just didn’t want to turn out like that 
The things I’ve said and done to people because I’m insecure make me hate myself and it was just for a couple of laughs with my friends I just hate myself but in a way there’s a sort of comforting feeling with how sad and shallow I feel 
The dumbest thing is I have nothing to be depressed or sad about other than maybe I’m lonely because I barely talk to anyone anymore 
Im sorry if this makes no sense it’s more of a vent than anything because I don’t know who else to go to or what to do with myself

"That awkward moment when your health anxiety was 110% accurate. Fml. I’ve spent my whole life not feeling right. My immune system has always been shit. Seizure activity as a child-teenager. Anyways, I’m 25 now and I had my adrenal gland removed a few months ago due to a benign hormone-secreting adenoma. It was found via MRI in October. 

Not even a couple weeks after surgery, I noticed extreme mental changes. Which led to paranoia. And then I lost 30+lbs and stopped sleeping completely. I would get SO angry over shit that wasn’t even important and I had to literally shut it down by cutting myself off from people. My hormones were a mess according to labs. I just KNEW something else was wrong.

A week ago today, I got an MRI which confirmed a brain tumor (of the pituitary). I have to have my concerns because I work in the medical field and I usually know what something is the second it starts creeping up. But I thought it was impossible to have another one present itself, even though my last tumor was benign. Fml.",2

"I need serious help. I am 33 and majority of my life has been alone, relationship-wise. Fell into depression, loneliness and co-dependency at 17. Despite loving travelling or doing many things with people, I have not because I have been alone and I would not be able to suspend the fact that I have no one to share the experience with enough to actually push myself to go. I had 2 2 year relationships, they both crashed and burned, involved people that I REALLY connected with and I am basically dead to both now. I want to get better but I have been so fucking lonely and while most people out there have the highlight reel of shit that they have done, I have got next to nothing. I intend on going into conversations with people talking about positive shit but I have had an extraordinarily boring life and so with nothing cool to talk about, I go to negative stuff in one way or another. Shit like trying to get comradery over the stuff we hate, like ""fuck lockdowns"" or Nickelback is such shit, blah blah blah. In the end I lose most everyone, everyone leaves. Then I get all burned out because I am fucking old with my best years behind me and I look at people (it is literally fucking everyone) people that travelled and done the events and pictures of them holding margaritas.Then if I ever try to reach out to someone or meet someone new, it is impossible to couch my severe misery and they fuck off quick because people around my age are married and pounded out 4 kids already and they do not want to hear the bullshit of someone struggling at square one. Online dating is an absolute fucking gutter and I waste days upon days upon days trying to get a decent response and even the morbidly obese think they are too good for me. I get ignored by literally everyone. I am in good shape, I used to think I looked good before online absolutely fucking destroyed my confidence and I am very financially secure but I am burning to death and it is taking my will to work, live, move. I will never find those great girls that I had in my relationship again as there is literally nothing out there when you take away the people that do not give a shit about their health, loaded with ugly tattoos, are completely void of a soul, are just online for vanity, or ignore you. I look around and everyone is coupled up and then I get ""do not make women your goal"", some more of this you have love yourself before you love someone else. Well, I am a person that yearned to be with someone since I was small and having loneliness instead just makes me wonder what the point is.. Tl;Dr - my mind has been filled with so much hate for myself, people, the disgusting selfish hedonistic blasphemous world that it is turning into and the fact that I squandered my youth right away while I am on the outside looking in on how EVERYONE did awesome shit, had loads of friends, did not have to struggle to go on dates.

"I have been thinking tonight and i think i had anxiety for more than i can think of. in first 2 years of uni and last year of high school i had a friend whom was anxious and he kind of gave his vibe to me, i panic a lot over small stuff. still it was worse when he was around and since i have not seen him i feel better but, maybe he induces my anxiety, other than that my mom does the same since she probably has anxiety issues but also depressed and taking depression pills. i do not know, i remember in first grade i sat down alone and just felt alone and dissatisfied, this feeling of dissatisfaction still continues till today. i had that feeling of loneliness maybe till 5th grade and then anxiety replaced it? i always feel i cannot trust people, nor they can trust me and i feel worthless. maybe its a relationship issue? i remember in kindergarten there was a girl that we liked each other but after that i moved out of that city.i feel lack of self-esteem and motivation, for last 4 years or so i have not done anything really, i guess i was more active in 7th grade(13yo) but it gradually went down till 12th where this guy came up and started his nihilistic crap and laziness and it felt like a hit on a nail and i failed 2 studies that year, me whom was acing before.was it puberty that messed me up? I am 22 now but i never had any relationship in my life, i was straight till 18, then anted to make my options more so i did not really care about gender till 20 but then again i feel i cannot get that emotional attachment to a same sex person. speaking of emotions i think i have emotional pain, sometimes my body, my chest and wrists hurt alot and i cry in my bed, i think i have this since when i was 13.i do not have much hope on stuff, things feel a bit numb, my studies are not going well and in last 2 semesters (thanks to covid) i have not seen many people and i did not study anything, but there were some friends around and we cheated the exams, which i personally have issue with. first semester i dropped a class because the guy gave points to everyone but i wanted to learn the topic so i dropped but now i just feel indifferent, i want to do stuff but i feel i cannot, i feel weak and not in control of my life, i feel i cannot stand for myself and get to anything that i ever want and if i want to do it, something will eventually go wrong and make me to lose. i feel failure is always there and its not a bad thing that happens and makes me sad, its just a part of everything i have or dream of, i guess i cannot achieve anything. i wanted to lose my weight for so long but anxiety made it just worse. i have lost much time that i cannot spend to experience and find stuff that i want i guess, or get skillfulled in two or three skills that i really want and i should just pass on. i failed my uni entrance exam in order to go to a good uni and went to a more normal one which i did not like, and i wanted to change it 3 times and the idea never left me and i still have nightmares about it, i tried to face and do it again but was just looking at an escape because it all was painful and was hurting me even more and someone told me to drop it, so i did stop taking re-entrance exam.i do not know what is wrong with me, i went to therapist 2 times but i could really speak since i just do not know.since this is too long i guess no one will even comment on this, huh i would not be amazed what is wrong with me?",1

"Just got prescribed Enlift, Xanax as well as magnesium for my anxiety. Do you guys have any insight on what to expect? Personal experiences? Hello! After dreading going to a psychiatrist for a couple of months I finally got the courage to do it and this is a big step for me. 

The doctor prescribed me Enlift , Xanax and Magnesium (which I've heard good things about it in this subreddit). Ive only ever been prescribed Zoloft, tried it for about 3 months and it didn't work for me so I'm basically going in blind. 

The doctor told me some basic instructions as well as explained how they work but it doesn't ease my anxiety about them, especially Xanax. (I generally get a lot of anxiety about medications tho not just this kind) . I know medications like these aren't a one-size-fits-all but I think it would ease my anxiety to know some of your guys personal experiences with them. I think knowing I'm not alone in this will make it less scary for me, especially with the stigma in my country around any medication for mental health.

"Convinced I'm dying from visiting auto body shop Hi everyone,

So basically I’m freaking out because I’m thinking about how I used to visit my estranged dad’s body shop from time to time growing up during the summer. I can’t imagine that I would have gone more than 10-15 times or so in a given summer, and some years I probably only went a couple of times, others none at all.

I would go to work with him to wash/vacuum cars, answer the phone, and sometimes wetsand cars. However, there would be times where I would follow him around to his back shop to check on his employees. Or, I would go back there to let him know that a customer was waiting for him. I’m currently freaking out bc I can’t imagine that being in that environment while guys were doing work could have been good for me, even though I wasn’t doing any sanding or painting myself. His back shop is rather large, and he would keep his garage doors open for ventilation https://imgur.com/FviJwNq see building on the left). I think I remember a couple of times in the winter I was there and he had the doors shut though. I probably opened the door to the paint booth a handful of times to scream in there that someone was waiting for him.

My biggest fear is that I’ll wind up getting cancer or something years down the line from now. I probably first went to his shop when I was 5, and stopping visiting after I was 18 or 19. I have no idea how secondhand exposure to this stuff works. Does this limited secondhand exposure to dust/paint as a kid pretty much guarantee problems down the road? Or does that typically require years of direct exposure?

Was my dad 100% in the wrong for letting me come to work with him in the first place? Part of me thinks that its quite common for kids to go their family-owned businesses, but still.

It’s gotten to the point where these thoughts dominate my mind, and its very difficult to care about anything, since I feel like I’m dead anyway.

I think its entirely possible that I’m overreacting, and this anxiety is brought on by the fact that I just graduated college and started my first job.

Can someone please let me know what they think?

Edit: I found some pictures of his shop so that you can see what the environment was like, for what its worth https://www.facebook.com/pg/Sudden-Impact-Autobody-INC-161287353937984/photos/?ref=page_internal",2

"what do I do? So 3 years ago I started experiencing a lot of anxiety and sudden depressive episodes that I didn't know the reason for. And then two months after I started profusely sweating in my palms, feet and armpits. And these symptoms are constant, almost never ending. I'm always in stress, worrying when I'm going to start sweating again and therefore get super cold and uncomfortable and unable to handle not only social situations but even doing something at home. I had to give up so many hobbies of mine because they make me feel uncomfortable now due to the hand sweating. Nobody ever told me what the hell happened to me and why I can't stop this no matter how hard I try... I know the sweating is psychological because when I miraculously manage to not think about it for a while, I'm okay. Or when I get drunk but I can't be drunk every day so I just have to bear with it. These past three years I haven't been living most of the time, I've been surviving and trying to stay sane. Though there are good days when I'm almost totally fine, there are periods when I've even thought about ending my life. I'm not sure what happened to me, if it was trauma or not... I just know nothing is helping me at the moment and I just want to ask if anyone here could give me some advise.
Btw I'm seeing a clinical psychologist and we're trying to work on it by various kinds of meditation, relaxation, stress relief but nothing works long term. I'm starting to feel like I can't relate to anyone and that my issue is so strange I'm probably the only person on earth experiencing this and it's just fogging my brain. I'm getting hopeless here, this week it's especially bad. And I'm scared that this will go on forever.",3

"I know people talk about how much we hate ourselves a lot here because it is very common for depressed people.

Now I might be kind of a worthless piece of shit but also I am not that bad. I do not get violent with people, I have never sexually assaulted or done something really fucked up to people. Probably the worst I have done is say some hurtful things and lie. Even though the rational part of my brain can look through all this and go 'well i guess you are not the worst piece of shit, it dosent really effect how I feel about myself. I still hate everything about me from my stupid body to my stupid mind. I know its probably a bit much for what I am but god fucking hate me.

"there is a lot of things about my illness that make life difficult, but one of the consistently hardest hitting things is the realization that life is not supposed to be this way.Things have been like this for so long that it just feels like the way things should be to me. I am not used to anything else so I just go through my day feeling dark and empty like its completely normal way to function.But every now and then something reminds me that most people are not like this. Most people are able to look outside and consistently see green. Most people go through every day without deathwish daydreaming. The way my life is is statistically not normal. And everytime I realize that, it hits with me with a truck.The main reason its so normalized is because almost all of my friends, when I express ideation, respond with same or make light of it. Its so normalized in my life because everyone knows how hard things are for me. But every now and then I meet someone who is neurotypical, and eventually I open up to much and they are shocked.For reference: if anyone here knows the game Doki Doki Literature Club, I was talking to my coworker and started talking about Sayori. I talked about her entire dynamic of masking suffering with humor, and her eventual fate. It was kind of a subtle projection. After I finished talking, my coworkers face went kind of dark and they became quiet. I am not sure if they realized where the thought came from or if they were just shocked and uncomfortable, but it was a reminder that not everyone expects life to be dark all the time.Sorry for the rant. I do not have anyone to talk to anymore. The realization is difficult for me",1

"I am just exhausted emotionally. I am on meds and they work for bit but then they stop. I am too embarrassed to make another appointment to get them fixed again.

Everyone else went to college and is graduating next summer. I have not even fucking started. Everyone else is moving out of their parents house. I cannot find a place to move to with jobs and rent I can make work. I just work a shitty cook job. And I am dumb and quit therapy. I do not know anymore. I am just in revolving door of confusion of what to do and it makes it so much worse. I do not know, I am just rambling",1
"I have done so much work. I go to therapy weekly. I am on medication. I have added so much to my emotional toolbox. I have learned how to cope with extreme emotional pain and how to keep going even when the pain seems unmanageable. I have taken great strides in managing my emotions on my own instead of word vomiting to whoever will listen. And still. I just feel bad. Everything feels pointless. My therapist says I should just accept that I feel bad and not judge myself for feeling bad, but I am so tired of it. I am so tired, period. I do not know who I am, and I do not know what I care about. It kind of feels like I do not care about anything. This is a new depression feeling. I thought I knew how my depression manifested, but every time I think I have got a handle on it, it changes on me. Its not fair. I have done so. much. work. Every time I think I get a handle on my depression, it changes",1

"Stressed about speaking a second language I’m doing this post almost holding a panic attack, but let's go.
I'm not an English speaker. Recently, I moved to a country (non-English speaker either) for a job (that only uses English). Everyone I’ve dealt with has some international background with a good spoken English or is native.
It's my first international position and my first time living abroad. And I've never been so stressed with my spoken English.
Last week, twice during a meeting, my boss mentioned it in front of everyone. Everyone with such a diverse background compared to my mediocre one. Since this situation, my confidence has disappeared, and I have felt that my spoken English has worsened.
At the same time, I've been so paranoid about it, that I noticed some behaviors that worried me (like being fixed on only consuming English content, avoiding and culprit myself for even thinking in my native language).
I'm petrified. I feel I'm losing the respect of my colleagues...
Does anyone have some ideas or suggestions? 
My writing improved a lot, but my speaking... Damn...",3

"When someone asks what do you want out of life, do you respond with qualitative or quantitative objectives? What really brings happiness? What the hell is happiness? Each individual perceives what it is differently, your perfect day might be someone is everyday. ""Normal""is different for each and every person. Achieving happiness is a daunting task, it is fleeting for many. Sustaining happiness should not be so difficult, but it is. You being here as a human being is a miraculous thing in itself. You are astonishing. No one knows what you have gone through to get where you are at besides you! You cannot put your happiness in someone else's hands. Go out and get your mind right. Do whatever calms you. Do whatever makes your heart beat a little faster. Make time for you. Do not give in to toxicity. Take a chance on yourself, because no one else will. You have to stand up for anything you want and grab it, hold on to it and cherish the hell out of it. In my 28 years on this earth I have only scratched the surface of what I can fail at, achieve or overcome. I have been lucky enough to have some great role models. I have also been lucky enough to meet people that I would not want to meet again. I embrace these interactions, then I use them to educate myself and move on. I practice patience to the fullest extent, it can be difficult yes, but what does an emotional response really help? Whatever it is that is bothering you will not matter in a year. Things can always be worse. Go out and do things, become better for yourself. No matter how much you think you cannot, you can. you have got this. you will find people along the way that want to bring you down. you will also find the ones that want to cheer for you and those are the ones. Those are the ones that you should open up to, find out their passions, cheer for them too. So many people are so lonely and do not want to admit it. Even the ones who are showered with attention and social butterfly's, have feelings of loneliness, yet no one addresses this. It gets swept under a rug. For this reason I challenge each and every person who reads this, to go out and ask someone how they are really doing. you will be surprised at the responses, regardless of it being positive or negative, be accepting and understanding. You could change their perception of happiness. One little domino could start the chain reaction of a new life, or a different path to their happiness. I am not sure why I felt the need to write this. I know what I have experienced throughout life thus far. I see life as a mountain, a challenge to get to the astonishing view at the peak. Embrace the climb, take a break to enjoy how far you have come already, sure look ahead to see where your going, but also look at where you are, retain everything you are able to.Thanks for reading my ramblings Just read it.",1

"I am in my mid twenties and ever since I am 13, my biggest dream was to have my own family one day. To find a great husband, get pregnant and have kids, be housewife for a while and raise the kids with all my love.I come from an abusive household (still am in there, long story) and never experienced a real family, I literally start crying whenever I see or hear other people talk about theirs. I am so miserableToday at work the realisation that I will die lonely dawned upon me. It feels like I am cursed just like my depressed sibling who is in their early thirties and also has the same faith like me.I am doing great at school and work but I do not care at all for this stuff. I do not want to become 30 or 40 years old with a great job, Id rather have the family life that I now realise I will never have. I am not asking for any advice or good words, I just needed to get this out and see if someone else feels like me even though I do not want to live, never wanted to, I am not going to kill myself and just suffer and be miserable every day. I am going to stop doing my makeup or skincare or dress well and just exist I do not want to live anymore after realizing Ill never have my own family",1

"Pretty much what the title says. I feel really positive and content with my life but there is this feeling that I cannot explain that lingers. I feel like I am just magnifying that unknown feeling because I really love and feel comfortable with where my life is going right now and out of those endless sea of positive emotions, that insignificant presence somehow stood out. It feels like the tiniest spec of dirt on my otherwise clean shirt, it is not really a big deal but as soon as I give it a shred of attention, the more my mind focuses on it. It feels like I am heading down this really clear road in life yet wondering aimlessly. It feels like I am the host and the parasite.It really does not make sense, I think I should not really be feeling this way. I love myself and anyone I surround myself with. I love my hobby ever since I was a child and not once did I ever felt bored with it. I love my life and I am living the life. But somehow somewhere, this feeling just appeared out of nowhere.

"I think many people are familiar with some kind of alternative of this phrase. It can be a good descriptor of what fighting with depression is like.For me, if feels like no matter how much I do, I can never be a normal person with normal feelings. Nothing is satisfying, nothing is enough to motivate me to do anything in my life. it is pure conscious pushing that gets me to do anything at all.Thus, barely surviving, but not actually living.My brother is watching a medical show, and I am with him in the living room. A character got in a coma and drama ensued. The doctor came in, and explained how she had no more motor function or something? And he says ""..she has no higher cognitive function. she is surviving, not living"" The quote gave me chills. Why is there a comparison between someone in a literal coma and me? But maybe this is a good description of how debilitating this dumb mental illness is. ""...surviving, not living""",1

"Hope this is allowed if not get rid of it . Just wanted to get something off my chestIm 22 recently graduated from college I found out at half one this morning thst i was rejected for my dream job (througha friend thst got onto the next stsge) . Another rejection to add to the list. I have already been rejected by all the other msjor companies in the field I am graduating into in this country. I am a laughing stock and a waste of space. A let down to my fsmily and all my dead relatives whom I promised that i would make proud. I have not. I cannot put myself through another interview process. How could I? I will be turned down . I know I am good at what I do but nobody can see that. The people who matter do not have faith in me. what is wrong with me? Why am i so useless as a person? As for my personal life? Another stream of rejections. Any time I get close to somebody romantically it takes them about 3 dates for her to realise I am a waste of their time. I am not a horrible person either. Quite the opposite I have been told that too often I am too nice to people. Maybe that is my lack of worth as a person manifesting itself through helping somebody else. I do not hate my life i just hate that I am who I am . I wish I could be anybody else. Somebody of worth. Somebody that is not humiliated every time they do an interview, every time they ask a girl out, everytime they think they are getting somewhere. Why bother? I am a waste of breath and I wish i could change thst but I am too far gone. Before you think my ill feeling towards myself manifests itself in interviews etc it does not i cover it up. And the last time i was told i was not good enough for a job ie todsu it was not even an interview as such but a task. I do not even know why I am posting this. It is not a cry for help, it is not a pity me fest. it is more so a case of needing to get it off my chest. Sorry for being a burden not only to you but onto my fsmily and my wider social circle. I had not seen a man more useless until i looked in the mirror. Have a nice day, i can assure you it will be better than mine I feel completely useless and hopeless. I am a joke of a person .

"Heart anxiety pvc, vt and cpvt Hi there. I want to begin to tell you that I have suffer from health anxiety for few years. I was actually good for 3 years until 10 weeks ago. 

Last two years I've had skipped beats. Doctor told me it was probably pvc and did no test. I believed him and continued with my life. These skipped beats would happened when in rest so I wasn't worried. Last year I had a hernia surgery and I couldn't run for 4 month's. Then last summer I noticed when I started running that my heart would skip beats or flutter more frequently during excersice. Sometimes just 1-2 times but sometimes 10 times. 

I saw a cardiologist and he did ECG, echo, stress test. My heart is structurally normal and everything looks fine except 1 pvc during stress test. 

I didn't have any anxiety and continue working out. Than 10 weeks ago I was running. I'm not in good shape because I'm scared of exercising. Everything went fine until I had pvc. I continued running and got few in a row! my heart started pumping and I felt numbness and my heart was getting pvc A LOT. I thought I was going to faint but I didn't. My friend called the ambulance. I freaked out When they came my pvc had stop and I just had 150 bpm. ECG showed nothing. Had a blood test as we'll and 2 more ECG which showed nothing. Docs told me nothing to worry about. 

I was fine until week ago when I was watching tv and relaxing. I noticed chest tingling. I took my pulse and it was fast. I had a panic attack and skipped beats, few in a row. I called a ambulance and they did ECG 2x and there we're no sign of anything. My skipped beats were not happening when they came. 

I had a holter and I'm waiting for the results but it only captured skip bear  while at rest. I'm trying to get on with my life but I can't take this anymore. I'm so anxious. Deep down in my heart I worry so much that I have Venticular tachardia because of those skipped beats while excsersising or panic attacks. They came more than 3 in a row and that is suppose to be a bad sign. I want to believe my doctors but I can't get it out of my head that they have never capatured my heart fast and inregular at the same time. Only pvc or fast sinus rate. 

I'm can't sleep I can't enjoy anything and I'm have been a mess last week's because of this Venticular tachardia anxiety. 

summary. I've experience at least two times fast rate and skipped beats. It also happened one time when I had adrenaline rush because of a bad family fight. My heart started skipping beats alot and sometimes even during dramatic sport events my heart races with skipped beats. It happens if I have adrenaline, if I'm excsersising and panic attacks and stress.Also sometimes when drinking alcohol 

I'm 24 year old 90 kg 185 cm never smoked have panic attacks and health anxiety. 

Should I worry that they have never capture my heart going fast and skipping beats? Any advice? be honest.
I had few good weeks with my anxiety but then googled some shit and found CPVT and it's giving me one helluva anxiety.

Im just playing everything in my head. I get more skipped beats when my heart is racing curing excersice or panic.
I have had ECG when it happened but my pvc had stopped already and it only showed sinus tachardia.

I just want to stop think about this. Deep down I know I'm 99% all right but my brain keeps getting what if especially with cpvt fear.

"You may not see my depression but it is with me at all times. It is the pooling of tears in my eyes while I am driving, making it hard to see oncoming traffic. It is the secretive, yet frantic wiping away of tears when I breakdown and do not want my significant other to see me crying. It is the laying awake at night staring at the ceiling, revisiting memories that inflict hurt and pain, and not being able to stop. It is the stressing about the future, and then reassuring myself its alright by realising that by then I probably would have taken my own life and will not have to deal with it. It is the staring out into the distance thinking of ways to kill myself, and not hearing a word someone said while talking to me. It is the zoning back in after and realising that my suicidal thoughts, so frequent, can devour my mind entirely at any time. It is the realisation that I have been suffering for years on end and likely will continue to suffer for the rest of my life. It is shaking of my legs and the biting of my nails. It is losing interest in literally everything and not knowing how to spend my days. It is distracting myself as much as possible so my mind does not consume me. It is not explaining how I feel to anyone because it is so much i would never get it all out anyways. It is becoming attached to one person and being so dependent on them even when I try not to be, it is feeling lonely and trapped in my thoughts every time I am without them. It is wanting to be held every time I am sad because I am scared I will hurt myself. It is my awareness that my mind is the real problem, constantly putting these thoughts in my head, but not being able to prevent it. It is finally being willing to give up dreams and experiences like having children and buying my first house because I do not think I can live like this much longer. It is my worst fear. It is my depression. Depression and I",1

Tears roll down my cheeks by this point and I think another day gone and it is not gotten better.

"What If You’re Doing Better Than You Think? It’s not unusual for a person to think they’re doing worse than they actually are. Some of us are pessimistic, others have limiting beliefs lurking: I’m not good enough, I’m not worthy – progress is just luck, setbacks re-enforce limiting beliefs.

### Consider these positive signs:

· **You reflect on, and learn from, setbacks and errors.** You arrive at a balanced view of these and develop clear plans to learn and continue growing. People often repeat the same errors over and over, whether it’s overspending or choosing a partner. People have a strong tendency to repeat their behaviors. But you can choose to respond differently – and achieve different outcomes

· **You’re clear on what you want – and why.** Knowing what you want is the second key step in getting it (knowing who and what you are is the first). Knowing what you want differentiates you from those who aimlessly floating through life.

· **You use time wisely.** We all have 168 hours each week and the choice on how to use them. You focus on what is important, within the context of who you are and what you have chosen to achieve. You have the habit of asking yourself what is the most effective thing you could be doing right now. 

· **You’re making consistent progress.** Consistent progress is a great sign. Even when your goals feel far in the distance, regular progress – driven by consistent effort and learning – will get you there. As well as planning what more needs to be done, reflect on how far you have already come.

· **You’re not alone.** There are many people are alone in the world. If you’re not alone, you’re doing better than many others.

· **You’re committed.** You know who you are and what you’re about. Your goals are clear. They create meaning for you, value for others and legacy for the future. Great things happen when your purpose and your environment align.

· **You consider other’s opinions.** You learn what is resourceful to you and discard what isn’t. You live your life, not theirs. 

· **You are grateful.** You regularly reflect on what has gone well and – crucially – on why it has gone well. You have skills and strengths you don’t even realise.

· **You’re authentic.** You know you values and beliefs. You make your decisions and take your actions consistent with these.

When you’re clear on what you have chosen to accomplish, and you’re spending your time wisely, you’re doing well – and better than most! This is true, even if the results have yet to reveal themselves.

**Genuine Desire + Effective Strategy + Consistent Persistence = Authentic Results**",3

My mental health has been destroyed for the past 16 years of my life. I grew up always having dreams about what I want to do in the future but I am stuck in a life where I am not allowed to have any control over myself. This kind of pain hurts worse than not being able to control my own life. I cannot wait to turn 18 and recover from the life I am being forced to live or die in the process. I cannot wait for people to give me my fucking freedom forever. I hate being 17,1
the title sum up my whole life perfectly i wa born to a loving caring family my father is my personal hero a real masculine role model who taught me pretty much everything i know my mother gave me all the love a child can ask for they were always supportive in all the good thing that i used to do but always very strict about the bad thing when i chose a career path they paid for a private school which i m so grateful for high school wa the best time of my life they supported me in sport i used to be an amateur middleweight boxer i love them both dearly that s why it hurt so much knowing that i m nothing but a disappointment a burden a leech to them i made the worst decision possible after i finished high school i got accepted into the best technical university in my country it is so embarrassing to think back about it now i actually thought it wa an achievement to study i m ashamed to even type this be free to laugh software engineering i can t explain how a person can do something so stupid i only recently found out that most programmer and software engineer with a master degree which only about of student finish make minimum wage if they are lucky i m from the czech republic central europe programming is a dying career here everything is getting outsourced to the east job are disappearing left and right moving to a different country is not an option since i don t know any foreign language except for english which i m really not good at a you can see and most position require you to know the language of that nation anyway if you want to work in poland you got to know polish etc it s soul crushing to think that all this hard work is worth nothing and even if i manage to finish my degree i m gon na be making the same salary a people with no education and skill whatsoever the minimum wage here in czechia is not enough to afford even a room apartment so i m either gon na live in my parent basement for the rest of my life or i m gon na end up homeless if they decide to kick me out and probably freeze to death when it get cold but then again i m the only one to blame here i should have been thinking more when choosing a career path it s too late to change my profession now firstly because of all the money that my parent invested into it i feel like cry writing that and secondly because i know deep down that i can only do this that i would be a complete failure trying anything else the moment reality of my situation hit me my life took a bad turn a you can imagine having those thought every day just ravage your mental health i can t sleep properly and there are sequence of day when i don t eat anything i m losing weight i would be a lightweight boxer by now but i stopped training anyway my grade got worse i get feeling of despair and misery every day i don t smile anymore i get no joy from anything all my friend are gone i m very lonely i m invisible to woman and i completely lost interest in pursuing relationship no woman is ever gon na date a homeless software engineer i can t remember the last time i had morning wood i m never going to have child my bloodline end with me sorry for the wall of text if you read it all the way here you have my thanks,1

"Unfortunately the cruel winter has taken him away. 9 years old German Shepherd. Fully black and monstrously large for a Shepherd. Today I went to see him, he shuffled out into the paddock full of beans. He walked up to me for pats, then he sat down and did not get back up. Trying to touch him, and he would bite me. he is never in 9 years bitten me before, or shown any aggression to anything. Poor thing, so much pain. The vet came and euthanised him out in the grass where he lay. Spent 3 hours digging his grave.I delivered him by hand, watched over him as a puppy as if he was my son. I wish I was not so depressed that I could have visited him more. I feel like the worst person in the world for ignoring that big, dopey, lovable boy. So much regret for not taking him to the beach last summer, or the summer before. I wanted to and had everything prepared, but I just do not care about life anymore.I started 2020 the happiest I have ever been in my miserable life. For the first time in my life, I was happy. I was actually fit and healthy, had a girlfriend who was the first true love of my life, lots of true friends, respect at work in a winery. It felt like maybe life was worth living. Lockdown happened, and lost it all. When things opened back up, I pulled myself up by the bootstraps for a while. Physically recovered and got fit again, new girlfriend. Then December happened. Unfortunately lack of healthcare meant I had a back pain flair up that nearly crippled me, work got super busy and all my coworkers took their frustrations out on me( probably deserved, but still not nice), and I got ghosted again. I just gave up on life. The past 7 or 8 months have been truly nightmarish. cannot leave the house, cannot talk to anyone, cannot enjoy anything or feel much of anything. I just do not know how to keep going.Well okay, the past couple of months I have started leaving the house and hanging out with friends at least twice a month. But after today, I just completely give up again.Hope I can get through the next 12 hours so I can make a doctors appointment. I know it will take nearly a year before a mental healthcare professional is available. But maybe my doctor can help. let us hope I can speak on the phone and ask for any available doctor. I bet I will be so choked up with anxiety I cannot speak.I think I will be safe at least for tonight. My body is probably broken after digging the grave. I cannot move my legs, presumably my back and hips have been strained.I know the rules say I must request personal support for myself or others. I cannot feel anything good right now. This is the best I can do. I need help and I do not know how to ask. Sharing has been cathartic. Perhaps that is enough for tonight.R.I.P. Mister Vinny. My best friend. My dog died today. Life was already meaningless.",1

"I have had depression since 8th grade, just finished high school, did not graduate cuz i gave up a long time ago. I had 2 attempts in july and September of last year, stayed at mental hospitals both times, and stayed at a longer 6-8 week residential facility back in feb-march where i kind of attempted there too. I genuinely do not think there is any hope for me. I have tried 4 or 5 different meds and they either never work or stop working after a month at the most. I do not know what i want out of therapy. I am in so much emotional and physical pain from the stress and anxiety. I am so suicidal and the worst part is we do not have insurance. Even if we did i do not think my parents would take me serious despite my history. Not to mention I am a trans male so that adds so much extra stress, my parents never research about any of my conditions or me being trans yet complain that i do not talk to them even though i try but they never listen or it just turns into an argument. I hate group therapy so that does not help. I feel so empty and angry at the same time. Why does life have to be this way? It feels so fucking unfair. My life feels so pointless. I do not feel like anyone loves me. I cannot remember the last time i felt genuinely happy for more than 5 minutes. I do not know what to do. I have never felt so low. This is how i felt before the attempts but my dad always reminds me that we do not have insurance or money and all that does is make me want to make sure it would not be an 'attempt' I lost hope a long time ago, but this is a new low",1

"When I read about people withdrawing during depression, I read about how they stay at home, etc etc.I have been struggling with depression for a long time now and recently got better, but now it is back to being bad again. Ever since I quit meds it is gone this route. I hardly maintain contact with friends and have now officially decided to take a break from social media.I know this is bad but the strange thing is that I still do everything else. I leave the house everyday. I grocery shop, do the dishes, laundry, I want to go to places like art museums and go out shopping or do writing/art but I want to be alone. I am not lying in bed all the time either.For some reason I just do not want to have any contact/talk to anyone. This concerns me but I do not know why I feel like this.I am also struggling to feel emotions right now and have lost interest in what I love, I seriously do not even feel human at some points, which might be why I do not want to talk to people, because I do not want to keep up this facade that I am interested in the conversation. Yet I am still going out and doing stuff and have some interests. I just feel totally dead emotionally?

One time she and him went all out on it  changing locks separated even her leaving me with my little sister for weeks to see random men she just met but took each other back my mom has bully me about my weight even called me a hoe a bitch a disappointment and how much she wants me out of her house and everything hurts my feelings even calls my undiagnosed (very much have it ) adhd a retard Thing  a problem and I have adhd and tells my dad about it like I’m. Such a retard….

"Hi all, I went through a really bad bout of depression last year (about 6-9 months) I cannot overly remember it as it feels like a big blur. I would just be holed up in my room after I got home from work and would lay in bed for hours, not eating, just scrolling through my phone. I was living with two people at the time who I considered my best mates (they were aware of my struggles with depression - I was quite open about it with them) but this was the worst it is ever been around them. Throughout those months they moved on with their lives - got boyfriends, promotions etc. which I am incredibly happy for them (they are extroverted and neurotypical) but they took my depression personally saying I was not making an effort with the friendship and that they felt like they were 'walking on eggshells' around me - this is a major trigger for me. I told them several times that it was not personal and it is hard to get excited over someone else's life if I cannot even get excited over my own. This caused quite a big riff in the friendship &amp; I pulled back considerably because it was also setting off major anxiety for me. Because I never wanted to experience this again I started masking my depression around everyone I know. But I have noticed that when I am alone I am spiraling worse than before - I feel like I am about to fall into a serious rut and I am trying to avoid that at all costs. Has anyone had any experiences like this? Am I actually doing myself a disservice by masking my depression? I am scared I might lose another 6-9 months of my life if I do not do something.

"Hello, I am not even really sure where to start. I graduated late from high school (a few months back) due to my learning disability and everyone around me just expects me to know what the hell to do with my life. Since the pandemic all the avenues I previously had mapped out in my head for jobs have died, due to seeing how the industries I was interested in have been affected. Now I cannot make any decisions on if college is even worth it too because, I wanted to go to help me get out of my she will, and social anxiety but, due to having to wear masks and social distancing and most colleges opting for online courses- I do not see how my social skills will even improve or how the experience is worth it. My high school was online for the last two years I went- and I assumed college would be different. People are also pressuring me to get a job, but recently I have not been able to see the point in that either as I do not want to commit to another thing where I am surrounded by people who make me feel empty. Part of me kind of just wants to die. I have been killing time trying to figure out what to do, and every single time I try to talk to someone who might give me any advice- they brush me off and tell me that since I am an adult it is my responsibility to figure out what to do. I have no passions left, the only interests I used to have are not ""job"" material. I feel like I fought super hard to get nowhere in life.

I am pretty smart, caring and I try to be a good person (I do not agree with it because of depression, but it does seem to be true), and yet I am still depressed. Is there a reason I am depressed?",1

"Kind of an update of that one post when I was feeling like quitting college sooner this year.[ I kind of got through my final year and took my final exams, only for me to fail. I thought that I would feel better with that whole college thing behind me but nos it just feels worse because I feel like I wasted 4 years and thousands in student loans for nothing. I do not feel motivated by anything anymore, and nothing really improved. I lost all my passion and all I do is letting myself rot in my bed all day. My family mostly thinks about how much they wasted by helping me paying off my college fees instead caring for my personal career opportunities and I just feel like everyone is letting me down since I am one of the few who failed. I have no more will to do anything nor to see anyone, and I even keep avoiding my roomate so I do not have any kind of human interaction because I am just a big ball of angst and do not want to project it on anyone (also because people are just a pain in the ass tbh).Now the ""best summer of my life"" is beginning by me feeling guilt and angst because of college and all my plans getting aborted because of sudden financial issues and me leaving the only small trip that made me feel a bit less stressed out because of health issues (and more fees yay).I do not really know how to feel motivated to do anything again and I just cannot get over that angst and disappointment feeling. Failed at college and is now feeling even worse",1
"No more long holidays already, routine life, you get to see friends less often and some people drift away.

Just a simple question for you to answer. Maybe it lightens up my mood. (Just discovered everyone I planed celebrating my birthday with has better things to do. As fucking always. Every year.)

"My mom found a bunch of old pill packages from when I did pills. I have been off of them for almost a year, and my mom is convinced they are new and I am going to overdose. I tried telling her that they were not from any time recent. She just says I am lying and now I am grounded from my friends. She goes through my drawers and searches my room. I am currently 17 and feel like I should be granted some form of privacy. She outright said she was going to continue going through my room and is convinced she is right and I am lying. I had a drug problem in the past so this kind of behavior would be normal 2 years ago, but after almost 2 years of sobriety from hard drugs, and the work I have put in to mend my relationship with my family, I feel like my effort is being ignored and my mom continues to call me a liar tomy face. She always pushes her religion on me, and will not allow me to be vaccinated due to her believing that vaccines are the mark of the beast. Yet I am the one who needs help. I am just so ready to leave this house. My parents will not Allow me to get an ID so I cannot even work to save up for an apartment. Literal tyrants run my life. My parents never believe me",1

"The pandemic has completely destroyed my will to live. I have lost interest in everything that I used to like and now actively hate a lot of them. I moved to a new city and have no friends. I have not seen anyone other than my parents in 16 months. I do not have any close friends who I can talk about my feelings to. I have a terrible relationship with my parents. They do not care that I am sad. I tried telling them about my feelings, I cried to them. My mom brushed them off and my dad threatened to beat me up in front of all my classmates. I feel left out of everything. My friends are making plans, hanging out, playing games. I am here struggling through a mountain of workload and suffocating. Toiling through 10 hrs of online classes everyday trying to keep my sanity safe. Everyone I have talked to reacts negatively whenever i try to talk about my feelings. My closest friend accused me of using them after I confessed to them that I am suicidal. I have no motivation to do or learn anything. There is no interest for anything left in me anymore. Everyone tells me that I am to blame for my problems. No one knows what I am going through. No one cares. My friends tell me that I have become bitter. I hate myself so much. I just want to die somehow. I do not want to kill myself. I am too scared to. Thousands of people die everyday, why cannot I be one of them? I feel so lonely. A lot of times I have dreams where I meet and hang out with people I love. I am so happy in them. Then I wake up and I am hit with reality that I will not ever be able to meet them again. I hate being alone.I do not think I have depression. I just wanted to post this somewhere because no fucking person is willing to listen and I am so sick of it. I hate it so much. I will get judged hard if I ever tell my feelings to anyone. it is ok if no one can help. I just wanted to speak out. I do not know what is happening. I just want to talk.",1
"Help for when your anxiety turns physical? I've had panic attacks and such, but one thing that's a bit more off and on is how anxiety affects my stomach. When I had daily stomach pains in elementary school that were unexplained - it now makes sense that it was definitely anxiety brewing.

I'm going through a period right now where my stomach is just revolting against me. I have the urge to go just about all day every day, and will sometimes go 2-4 times a day (when my usual is once a day), plus it's now usually loose, which wasn't an issue before.

The only thing I've found to kind of help is Tazo Zen tea. It does ease the stomach upset a bit, but I also can't drink THAT much of it before making myself nauseous/even more sick. How does everyone deal with this in terms of their anxiety? I only have this issue on weekdays when I have work, I'm usually normal on weekends, so it's obviously the anxiety. I just feel tortured by my stomach right now. I also meditate, which only helps for me while I'm actually doing it, so the anxiety comes right back as soon as I open my work computer, basically. 

Anything soothing for the stomach would be great... although I will say, I am currently dieting (wedding in June) and trying to stick to low-point foods/drinks on WW.",2

"going back to school i dropped out of high school, let me explain. 

when i was a freshman covid happened and i did online school up until i was a sophomore. Then schools switched back in person but i’ve always struggled with it, i’d get bullied, my friends would ignore me, and i’d just be alone all the time, the teachers hardly helped me, they always favor the popular kids. It’s not their fault. 

i tried a program for my junior year, they said they’d help me get the credits i needed. It was all online, at first it was okay, but after a month they dropped the bomb. I got a bunch of homework that was due within a week, then they wanted to do a test that was a huge factor in my grade and they wanted me to turn on my camera and answer every and any questions they had, and based on that they would give me my grade. It gave me bad anxiety, i wasn’t learning anything, the whole thing was just “do this do that” so i gave up. 

since then i’ve been thinking of getting my GED, my oldest sister got her GED, my friends brother got his GED, so maybe i can get mine? But i’m scared to go back into any sort of school setting, my anxiety was so bad in high school i couldn’t walk alone in the hallways, i felt like everyone was judging me or laughing at me. I could never make it to class even if i did i’d end up leaving. 

There’s a online option for getting my GED but i’m scared it’ll just be like that program i did and i won’t get any help, that i’ll just leave it again and never finish my school. But if i do in person i might have a breakdown, or disappoint my parents again, i hate that look in their eyes when they found out i had given up on school, like i’m a disappointment. 

what do i do, i feel hopeless. i wish covid hadn’t had happened, maybe i would’ve pushed myself to stay at that school

if you’ve gotten your GED or have info on it or advice please please please tell me",1

"My roommate and I use to date but we broke up a couple of months after we moved in together. We get along fine and are still good friends. But only after 2 weeks of our break up, she already moved on and found someone to call her bf. I am fine with her breaking up with me. It just hurts that she is already dating and it makes me feel like we never had love to begin with. She tries to give me help and advice about love but then she contradicts herself by doing something that is the opposite of what she told me. It makes me question if I was truly loved or if I will ever be able to form a relationship with someone. And she wants me to talk to her bf when she brings her over. He is a nice guy and I there is nothing wrong with. I just do not want to talk to him because of the situation with me and my roommate.And it just makes it even more awkward when she asks me to leave the apartment for a while so they can fuck when she knows damn well I have nowhere to go. She is a good friend and her bf is good person, but fuck I cannot stand their relationship. My roommate is messing with my view on love.",1

"I have been with my partner for nearly 3 yrs now and we have never once had sex, hes been really patient with me. While we have never had vaginal intercourse we have done other things, and I sometimes struggle with depression bringing down my libido. But for weeks now I have been struggling having any sort of intimacy with him. Last time I broke down crying as we made out with his body over me, he did not notice as the lights were out. And he began to move his hands and the combination of anxiety and fear of him feeling my cuts (started self harming recently) made me run, I left immediately and told him I could not do it. Prior to that I have had tears run down before but this time it was more and I felt as if I was suffocating. I love him, and I am attracted to him but when this happens it feels like I am not there, almost like I am just watching myself but I have no control over my body. I know I can tell him to stop at any moment but it feels as if I am mute and cannot bring myself to do so. He does not even know I struggle with depression, no one does, he just thinks I am saving myself or waiting for the right time. We were relatively young when we started dating as well so it makes sense that we have not had any relations during the 3 yrs. its scary when I disassociate, I know hes someone I trust and love but it feels like rape in a way. I am not comparing the two but I do feel powerless, and its not even his fault. I cannot be intimate",1

I have been so laser focused on my career that i paid no mind in catching up with others and keeping up with friendships. The effects have now started to hit like a truck, and it burns. I know what I need to do to fix that. But I am afraid that I am too deep in the void and that it might be to late. But for now, I just want to drown in my sorrows before I move on.

Only to wake up the next day and have the other three friends text me that they couldn't come either for varying reasons and they were ""so sorry"". I was so upset the entire day. I had told my mom about it and she had told me that what I didn't realize was that none of them were really my close friends, since people that are actually friends don't flake out like that, plus none of them have ever come over to my place or vice versa or done anything more than hang out every now and then.",3
"I have (21F) have struggled with Major Depression for the past five years. The past couple weeks since I quit my $8 job ($8/hr as an assistant manager. it is laughable) I saw a big lift in my depression and things were looking up. Then I started my new job. I was excited at first to be back in an industry I loved back when I first entered the workforce (hospitality), but after my first day I remember the reality of working.The concept of working my ass off forever just to survive makes me sob uncontrollably. I cannot stop thinking of how I have no control over my life because I am forced to work to feed myself. And as an anti-capitalist I know the solution but it will not happen for a long time. So I feel stuck. The usual, boomer advice to ""just get a new job!"" Absolutely does not work. I have worked in just about every industry; entertainment, hospitality, retail, customer service, physical labor, and more, and it is all the same. I see no way out. No end in sight",1

"My hypochondria has returned severely after a night of heavy drinking I basically remember having episodes of debilitating hypochondria since I was 16 all the way up to recently. Now I'm 23 and I have had a relatively health anxiety free year. Four nights ago I went out drinking with my friends and we all had a terrible experience, blacked out, awful hangovers with a whole lot of symptoms and it's brought back my hypochondria full force. 

Now I'm worrying about stupid things again like whether or not I inhaled too much of the spray cleaner I used because it'll give me lung cancer, or how I'm so anxious it'll give me heart problems, maybe a clot or a stroke, also is the food I eat tainted with some carcinogen, am I being poisoned by my environment, etc etc it's never ending. 

I am for the most part physically ok, some slight headache and nausea but so much better since that first day post drinking. Yet my mental state is now a mess. 

I don't know what I'm expecting of this, just needed to let it out. I don't want to go through this again. It's taken away so much from me already. ",2

People after someone has killed himself say that he was a selfish guy .. he just thought about himself .. he did not even think how His parents will feel after he has gone .. how his friends family members will feel The problem is that they do not understand the mental state of him .. He is such neglected and isolated from his real life .. so much problems in daily life daily fights with parents about his career his studies that in his subconscious he starts thinks no one gives a fuck about him .. nobody cares Whether he is here or not .. even if he is gone there will be no one remembering .. because when he is alive there is no one who is with him .. so he just feels that I should go.. And that leads to a sucide. THE REASON WHY THEY SUICIDE,1

I finally was going to take the steps in an attempt to improve my mental health by admitting myself to an intensive outpatient program for a few weeks. It would have been 5 days per week from 9-3pm.

"I'm bad at taking meds I think they might help me but I'm just awful at sticking to taking meds. I start off taking them everyday for maybe a week then I quickly fall off and start ""forgetting"" to take them. I'm not avoiding them. I literally forget that I'm even on medication. Plus medication in general tastes horrible or the pills are huge and get stuck in my throat and just hurt going down in general, so I almost prefer to forget. And even when I manage to finish a whole bottle, it doesn't do my laziness/motivation any good because I will then procrastinate asking my doctor for a refill, and procrastinate going to the pharmacy, or sometimes I don't feel like taking my money and spending it on meds that week or something always comes up. And the longer I put off refilling the meds is more time my body is without the meds, and whatever effects they might've been having are never able to reach their full potential. And for the short time that I take these meds, I don't see much change, in terms of helping or even side effects. They may as well be placebo. And since I get no benefit in the short term, it makes it hard to stick with in the long term. I'm not motivated enough to keep taking them. I can never stay consistent with medication which makes it difficult to even get better, I just feel hopeless. I have all these problems but can't stay consistent with the possible solutions to help me and always end up back at square one.",1

"I'm relapsing on my past HA, at least right now. [Long post] In October of 2017, I had my first actual panic attack and it was massive. I never figured out where it came from, but I ended up in the ER for fear of a heart attack. Had all the symptoms just about. This occurred about 2-3 more times within a week or two and it got to the point that the doctor got frustrated and told me I was wasting the ERs time and money on potential people who may actually need it and gave me a low amount of Xanax and a referral for a therapist. After then, I had lingering chest pains for seemingly 24/7, so I also went to a cardiologist and did several tests from ecgs/EKGs to wearing a heart monitor for varying times, with one month being the longest. Turns out my heart was 100% healthy and the healthiest he had seen in years, which was surprising considering I was a smoker and drank too much caffeine and drank a bit too much. I still smoke, drink caffeine and drink here and there but I've cut down tremendously since. I was in therapy for 6 months. It mostly involved us talking things through, but we also got to a point where I would try to purposely induce attacks so we could with through them together in order to learn how I can tackle them by myself. Another thing we did that helped was write down my current health fears (biggest one was fearing a brain aneurysm would come at any time because of my constant headaches and ice pick headaches) and I would also write why it was making me scared. Then I would come back for my next visit two weeks later and she'd have me read what I wrote and it always sounded insane but never ever for me to stop being worried entirely, but overtime it got better. I was diagnosed with hypochondria/health illness anxiety. I have since moved to California after being in therapy for 6 months. For whatever reason, it was like a complete 180, from worrying about it all the time to not worrying about it much at all anymore. I would still get some attacks here and there but I always managed them one way or another.

Lately, I've just been more down than usual and I plan on seeing another therapist to try and tackle that, but I think it's partially making the hypochondriac I am come back out. Example: about two nights ago, I was getting ready to take a nap, but I was on my phone for a few, getting settled, propping myself with my right hand/arm on my side. Later, I would wake up and I started gaming a bit after, but I noticed my upper right arm and lower shoulder have sharp pains after moving it a few certain ways. I brushed it off because I figured, ""I probably put too much strain on it when I was on my side before my nap"". Well it's been a few nights now or so and while it hasn't gotten worse, it hasn't gotten better, I think. Fine, whatever. But then I noticed pains in my forearm, closer to my wrist that would come and go slightly. Then I started feeling that later in my right forearm. Today I was pulling weeds and when I got back up, my shins had sharp pains for a few minutes. I was feeling off and light-headed and thought I may be dehydrated because I drank last night and didn't really do a good job keeping myself hydrated then. So I did the worst thing possible - I googled dehydration symptoms. When it becomes ""severe"" and should seek help, etc. Granted this was just all on the same page, but I didn't have to read it. I legit just wasn't sure if it was dehydration and it did more hurt than it helped. I'm feeling better after some water, but now while I'm not constantly Googling anything on the exception to see what the symptoms of dehydration were and effects it could have on the body, I'm fighting that feeling of being worried about the pains I mentioned above. If it was just the shoulder pain, or just the here and there forearm pain or the mild discomfort I feel in my fingers... basically if I just wasn't feeling pain in varying intensities and one or two areas, I could easily reason with myself.

I haven't seen my doctor in a couple months and I'm going to make an appointment in the morning and talk with her about it and see what we can do, as well as probably set up to see another therapist for what I'm assuming to be depression. But I'm feeling myself slipping again and I'm not ready to deal with even a fraction of what I dealt with before.",2
"Wondering about mental health (depression?) Advice/comments welcomed and appreciated.Preface: I know I cannot get an actual diagnosis from this site, but I would really like to get peoples opinions/thoughts on this. I am just going to dump a bunch of information here, and I am sorry if its too long. I am going to treat this like a rant, so it will not be organized.Over the past couple of years, I feel like my mental health has been declining. In 2019, I started spending more and more time alone in my bed, and its continued on to this day. I have been passing it off as laziness (Ibe been a lazy person in general for quite a while), but I think its more than that, because I used to only have short periods of laziness. In other words, I used to have occasional lazy days, but now every day feels like a lazy day. I sit on my bed, watching YouTube, listening to music, daydreaming, and checking my apps. When I am not working (I work part-time), I mostly just do these lazy activities.I also currently have a lack of hobbies- probably related to laziness. I want to pursue hobbies and interests like I used to. I want to spend time doing something I enjoy. But, I just cannot get the motivation to. I feel like I cannot get the motivation to do much, even low-effort activities or tasks. My lack of productivity and hobbies has led me to think very negatively about myself. I feel like I am skill-less, talentless, boring, and useless. Its a vicious cycle: lack of motivation = not productive = more negative thoughts. I have also noticed that I am not excited over things Id normally be. For example, I recently went on a short vacation, but I generally felt bored throughout it, when normally Id be anxious and excited to do things. I felt like I could not get excited. Aside from COVID, nothing huge has happened in my life recently that would typically evoke depression, so its hard to pinpoint where this is coming from, and that is frustrating. I also do not feel too bad (its like a constant meh with occasional dark days), or mentally suffocated, like people with depression have described, so I am not sure. I sorta feel like I am overreacting or being dramatic. But I am also quite concerned.To summarize: I am constantly lazy, I am not productive, I have lots of negative thoughts about myself and my life, and I feel like I am in a constant state of boredom and indifference. Wondering about my mental health",1

"My mother (50F) has been living in the apartment (that she and my father owns) for 2 years. The apartment is definitely a downgrade from the last apartment (rented) we lived in 2 years ago. It was in a more posh and quiet area while this is in the outskirts near a highway. However, this has all the amenities and is in no way a bad place to live in.My mother has always complained a bit about the sounds of vehicles and how hot it gets in the summer in this apartment because we stay on the top floor however, for the past 2 months she has become incredibly irritated with it. She cries about how much she hates it and how much she regrets buying the apartment. We have air-conditioned it for her comfort but she still gets anxious about anything and everything. She was recently diagnosed with very high levels of Thyroid and she has been suffering from insomnia and fever every day for the past few months which can explain a lot of the discomfort but it seems like she will not find peace until we move which is not feasible for us and she knows it and becomes more regretful for complaining.I think my mother misses our last apartment because it was bigger and the whole family (me, my brother, my father, and my mother) lived together there. She knows I will have to leave once I get a job and unlike some of her friends whose children are home due to the pandemic, my brother still works and lives in a different city although he is working from home there. Recently I and my parents visited him and stayed at his place for about a week my mother really liked the fact that we all were together for a week and she said she felt because of the cooler weather in his city even though his home was a mess. She was dreading coming back home and now that she is home, I see her shaking and crying. I have tried to talk to her but she tells me that I will not understand what she is going through and it was her mistake that she agreed to move to this apartment in the first place. My dad and I do not know what to do anymore. We cannot move because of money issues.Could it be depression? I do not think she is open to get professional help so is there any way I and my family could help? Is she associating her home with bad memories? We used to move every 2 to 5 years because of my dad's job so is that a way she has been coping with bad memories for the last 25 years and now she cannot because my dad has retired and this is supposed to be her permanent home? My mother hates the apartment she lives in. Is it because of depression?",1
"I feel like I'm finally ready to end it all. These last 5 years have taken such a toll on me, that I just don't have the will to go on. My father was never in my life much, and my mother was more interested in alcohol and weed than myself and brothers wellbeing. The only paternal support we've really had is from our grandma. She has always done what she thought was best for my brother and me,, though she wasn't always able to give us the emotional support we needed. I've struggled with anxiety and depression since I was a teenager, and never had any sense of self worth or respect. The friends I had were their for convenience,  we shared some similar hobbies, and I was willing to do whatever they needed if that meant we could hang out. When I was 22, I started hanging out with a kind of bad crowd. We mainly got high and went to festivals and got drunk downtown. There were fun moments, but eventually an incident happened at a festival and I stopped hanging out with them. I did coke for the first time at this festival, and they all left me alone for the day. Afterwards, I stopped hanging out with them, more so out of getting my head straight, but none of then reached out to ke. Even to this day. I still see them from time to time around town, and they've all moved on to become better updmstanding people. Still hanging out together. Without me. After that happened I focused on work, did a bit of job hopping, started being healthier, lost a ton of weight (I was obese from middle school up to 23), and eventually my brother and i moved out into another apartment together with our grandma. He soon met a woman and got married, and they moved into their own place, so it was just me and my grandma. I did eventually meet a girl, and after a year I also moved into a place with her when I was 26. It was good for awhile, but her mom hated me. I wasn't extremely religious. I'm not against it in any way, but I don't need a book to tell me how to be a good person. She judged me from our first meeting, especially since I didn't come from a good stable background. I'm glossing over a lot but it had a significant impact on our relationship. We live there together for 1 year. I don't know when it started, but we would get into these intense arguments. She had a lot going on with her family and job,  and along with covid and isolation, the stress was too much for us to work through. After 7 months of living together we broke up. I left the apartment and went back to my grandmas place. We tried to stay friends, but I've realized that the changes in her personality have become too toxic for me. She knows my struggles with my insecurities, my depression, my anxiety, and even my family issues. Up until yesterday, she used that to manipulate me into being there for her emotionally. I kept struggling to break away, but she would bring up my past mistakes in our relationship and guilt me to continue being there for her. Anyways I went back to one of my old jobs, and was there until this past January. I left because I felt like I reached my peak. The customers were getting worse, we got a new manager who complete changed everything to their liking. I was overworked and felt undervalued. I didn't have a game plan, I just knew that for my mental health I needed to leave. Since then i havent found any kind of job. Since i left school, i dont hsve any qualifications except for retail, fast food, and other menial jobs. In the past year I gained back all the weight I lost. My body has been going through certain issues that I truly can't even afford to go to the doctor for. My grandma, bless her heart, hasn't  been too pushy about me finding a job. But I can see her irritation in her eyes. I know she's concerned about me isolating myself in my room. I don't even play games much anymore. I just waste my days browsing online, looking for jobs, and then just laying in bed thinking of my life. I have no one close around me. I have no friends, no SO, and I can't even talk to my brother about my depression. I know he's going through his own stuff, and he's tried to get me to play games with him but I feel like he should just focus on himself. The last two days I've been contemplating my life, my place in the world. I've come to the conclusion that I am just someone who doesn't belong. I'm not destined for a good life, not even an ok life. When I felt it was good it was ripped away from me, despite all my efforts to fix everything. I'm starting over from the bottom. Living with my grandma again. Overweight, jobless, and no real worth. I always felt so shityy for it, but I finally made my peace. I've struggled with suicide though a lot lately, I was afraid of actually going through with it because of my grandma and brother. Even my mommombit. I know they will be heartbroken, i know it will take some time for them to recover, but they will eventually. My grandma is so emotion strong, and my brother, while he will be more hurt from it, is also stronger than me emotionally. He also has his wife there to support him. We used to talk about suicide when things were bad, and he always said no matter what happened to us he would never be Ble to go through with that. I used to think I couldn't either....I guess I truly am a weakling. I know it'll be hard for them, but I feel that their lives will be so much easier once they don't have to worry about me anymore. I've made peace with it. They were the last things holding me back, but I don't feel worried anymore. They'll be able to live their lives when I'm gone, and I won't be a burden for them and for myself anymore. I'm exhausted. Every day is such a struggle to get up and try. Lately I've been having nightmares. They've gotten worse, and I feel this is the only way to stop. I'm tired of fighting, I'm tired of trying. I've accepted that I'm not meant for anything, and I've accepted I don't deserve happiness. I'm ready now. For the first time in 5 years I've bought some wine. I hate wine with a passion, but it aas on clearance and I just needed to get my head to stop thinking. Once she leaves for work tomorrowi think ill just drink myself stulud. I dont know whatll happen, maybe i wont go through wjth it, but this is the first time ive felt good about ending it. All i can think of is how itll be overoveri wont have to suffer anymore, i wont be a burden anymore. I wont be worthless anymore. Ill be forgotten, which i am ok with. If you took the time to read this I thank you wholeheartedly.  I know it's a bunch of ramblings, but it feels good to get it off my chest. I feel like with this I can take that step, and I will finally achieve peace. I hope if you read this, don't be like me. I am a weakling, but I hope you can use this to push on. Do what I couldn't do. I wish you the best of luck",1

"How being outside reduces stress I will explain why being outside is good for your health. Nowadays we are often indoors almost all day because of school and work. There’s not always something wrong with that, but you’ll probably feel a lot better if you go outside every now and then.

**IT MAKES THE MIND CLEARER**

Inside a house, study or workplace there are often many things that make you think about your work or study. There is nothing wrong with this, but it can ensure that you are constantly busy with your work or study. This may keep you thinking and living in your head instead of in the moment. In addition, there are all kinds of other distractions indoors that keep your mind from calming down. So go outside and enjoy the tranquility.

**LESS STRESS**

This tranquility automatically reduces stress. You are not busy with school, your work, or other things. As a result, you go out of your head and into the moment. This will also reduce your stress and reduce the risk of stress symptoms and complaints. In addition, physical exercise is also a great way to reduce stress. When you are physically active you can reduce stress. You probably also feel that when you exercise. And after you exercise you notice that your stress is reduced compared to before you started exercising.

I have always been depressed and it all blew up a few years ago and i ended up having to quit public school and attend therapy for the first time. I really clicked with her and went to her for a year+ and felt the happiest I have ever been but she decided to stop seeing me after learning of my issues with self harm and i was transferred to a new therapist.they quit after 2 appointments and now i have this current one who i do not click with at all and do not see myself improving with her. I have been waiting to see her inhouse psychiatrist for months to finally get my medicine changed and ughhh just nothing is progressing or getting better. My mom keeps promising she will switch me but that is been said for 7 months now. i just want to talk to my old therapist again or just quit therapy all together its just not working out for me. id rather rot in bed and be depressed all the time. bit of a rant sorry I am just not sure what to do. missing my past therapist,1

That was kind of a bummer to hear since I feel my life is extremely laid back and I don't feel depressed but somehow I'm supposed to be smarter with the help of therapy? Does this make sense to anyone?

"So bit of background first, I am in my early 20s and diagnosed depression and anxiety disorder, I have been taking 40mg citalopram for the past 7 months. Before that I would been upped from 10mg - 20mg then 30mg-40mg 3 months prior to being on 40mg long term.I do not know where to begin honestly as there is alot i could talk about , i could go on for a while. So i just have one question really. Also kind of a vent but I will try and keep with it.So on and off since I was around 13/14 I have always fantasized my own death, like it was never a common occurrence in my mind but when it did prop up it would stuck for a while (usually from around to 1-2 weeks). At this time I would just think about if I did die, how people would react to it and if it would be worth it.This faded around 16 after I tried to take my own life and had only just started to get help as I had a myriad of things going on in my mind I just could not understand and it frustrated me. As soon as I started college a few months later I had dropped all the help I had been given and then just started to crumble and took to drinking and using drugs.When I inevitably left college after quiting my 2nd year towards the end due to an incident, my mental health went on a huge decline.Everyday I just feel like I am all out of energy, like my own body has given up. I think about past events constantly, wishing I could change them. How things could have been if I did not make one simple choice here and there. Just constant regret playing on a loop in my mind and it is just tormenting. This lead to me thinking about myself dying alot more than I have in the past. In the past 6 months alone it is just been constant, it burdens my mind daily no matter what I do. I cannot find joy in anything at the moment or even stick to a single thing and keep myself motivated as my mind always slips into grim thoughts no matter what.The enjoyment has been stripped from my life, right now it just feels like I am completely lost and idk what to do anymore. The days roll on without me even noticing anymore as I just cannot focus properly.I am getting professional help but I just feel like it is not working anymore, they just speak to me and it is just words that mean nothing really. I have kept to my medication and have tried to follow advice but all motivation is gone.I feel so lost rn, I have no direction. No goal, no motive. No anything really, I do not have a life as its just thoughts and nothing else. Idk what I am asking. Is it normal? Is there any advice you could give? How do I break the cycle of thoughts and just let myself be me, it is getting really hard to like keep having to deal with it day in and day out Question?",1

"It took year 30 to accept that i was depressed for most of my 20s. I did not work, very over weight, i laid on a makeshift bed on the floor all day and night, went no contact with the very little friends i had, hoping for the day i had the courage to finish it....but I never questioned why i felt like this. One day my mom took me to Mexico, because apparently i had black magic casted on me.....total BS in my opinion, but.......but that trip was the breath of fresh air i need, because I final understood and accepted that I was depressed.....I had a sickness that can be cured (mananged really, to be honest I still have stints of depression, but mostly the physical aspect no negative thoughts). I have a decent life: good job, own place/car, still working on the weight loss, but I am doing my best with the extra years I was given on that trip to Mexico. People always ask the question: what would you do if you could back in time? Obviously, never going to happen. The closest to this is that if a younger person than me reads this and feels how i felt: Its okay to admit and accept that you have depression, because that is the first step to recovery, do not feel ashamed: admission is the first step.

But definitely worried it is messing up my liver or something dangerous. Anyhow.

"For anyone on the fence about journaling, this is my experience so far... So I enjoy journaling for a few different reasons, and as I continue to do it, and get better at it, the more natural it feels, allowing you to really make use of it and get something out of it. Before this recent journaling expedition I had NEVER journaled.  Maybe stupid little doodles and quotes from songs or something in notebooks, but not really journaling, or for any real purpose.  I was somewhat curious and interested in the idea, as it had always been suggested to me by programs, institutions, therapists, etc..  however, I couldn't get past my biggest hurdle which was how to begin journaling without feeling really, really, silly, or like some teeny girl in highschool writing about people she doesn't like or her crushes or whatever.  It just felt awkward and silly.  I debated on doing it for a while and I think one day I said to myself to just do it, see how it goes, and do it day after day or just twice a day, even if all I write is a sentence, or a gratitude, or a to do list, the idea was just to start doing it and developing the healthy habit.  So my first entries were very crude.  I'm looking at one now and it basically says : 

THC NJ is COOL
APPLY TO JOBS
START NEW RPG
GONNA COOK STEAK
START READING DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP? (finished it that week)
THIS IS MY 1ST TIME JOURNALING
MAY ADD MORE LATER, lol
TALKED TO LILY BILLY, need to more often

Then l stated a short gratitude for the day.  This first journal entry I was grateful for reddit, cause I believe I made a post prior to writing that entry asking for tips on how to journal.  I posted on a few mental health groups, a few addiction or drug based subs, and a few writing subs and got all sorts of helpful tips, but my first few entries remained pretty crude for a week or so.  My first entry was on 2-12-23. So I've been doing it almost daily, some days multiple times in one day, and some weeks I'll go 3 or 4 days without journaling like just recently, but I don't like doing that cause now I notice a sort of disconnect from myself when I don't journal habitually.  It's constant confirmation of all your thoughts and beliefs, and you see how your idea develop and progress.  Thinking something and thinking something then writing it down on paper, physically putting the idea into the universe helps establish it.  

I skip a week or so into my journaling and now I'm talking to it more like how traditionally people think journaling goes.  Like raw free thought sort of, that's definitely a very important part of journaling though you can and will develop your own entire journaling style based on your needs, or what you want out of it.  I thought I would hate the free thought aimless formula but it's what I use the most now, because the habit of writing allowed me to get comfortable with it and explore it's benefits.   I just moderate it by USUALLY including short term, or long term goals, gratitudes,or something. But not always, if you don't feel it you shouldnt force yourself.  You don't wanna say a bullshit gratitude just to write something for gratitude.  If you don't feel it don't write it.  So yeah fast forward in my journal and I'm talking about the day we went to the park after group and we smoked a bit and played football and frisbee and saying how nice it is, before that  some goals and gratitudes.  Short term goals.  I begin to write about accomplishments I've made and things I see different in myself.  I talk about some of my inner growth but I'll mention a specific think like in how the past year and a half I've been fucked up like 20 of those days.  Or how I feel my brain is finally begin to repair itself cause I can feel some sort of natural euphoria at times.  Dopamine release is finally becoming more regulated.  I'll write how I finished a book in a week and that's also an accomplishment.  A big accomplishment I had to write down was hygiene.  When I was in heavy active addiction, or even sober just severely crippled with depression I'd go a month without brushing my teeth, weeks without showering.  So I wrote down that accomplishment.  It effects self esteem, ego and confidence.  When you go back and read goals you had and accomplishments you've made, on a daily basis you get to physically see growth or change in yourself instead of just feeling you're doing better.  You have written proof, you're logging your mental state everyday and you go back after a month when you forget what you wrote and you're like oh shit wow, I can't believe I actually accomplished that, or shit I can't believe I even WANTED. To accomplish that.  Being able to go back and read what you wrote after you forgotten it is a visceral feeling.   Theres no real WAY to journal and I'm still figuring out my best way but it changes, some days it's free thought, one day it's lists and goals and gratitudes, sometimes a healthy mix, sometimes it's something funny that happened that day (good to go back and read on funny moments you'd otherwise completely forget about, it can immortalize them so to speak) sometimes it's topics I wanna go down rabbit holes on YouTube and I'll mention it in the journal so that if I forget I'll  come back to that page on my own at some point and remember.  I could imagine how amazing it would be to have years worth of your own personal journals now.  Must be pretty fucking cool.  Get to see huge change in yourself and never forget where you started.  Reddit gave me an overwhelming amount of GOOD information and I took what I thought would work for me, still plan to read more on journaling tips soon as I wanna evolve it further and do more for with it, but I've been doing it for a like a little over a month so ill keep learning and adding journaling objectives as I continue doing it.  All in all journaling serves to strengthen your relationship with yourself.  I know my explanation wasn't the best, so I recommend also searching reddit or Google on your own for more journaling tips that work for your needs.

I have had a gastroscopy before but never gotten a colonoscopy because that makes me anxious. Gastroscopy showed that I have no reflux and everything looks good, biopsies from my duodenum came back normal, no coeliac disease or other diseases. I just can't stop worrying if I have an IBD and that is what is causing my mouth symptoms. Would Crohn's disease show on the biopsies taken from my duodenum? I just feel like it would be real unlikely because no-one in my family never have had an IBD and I don't smoke (Apparently smokers are twice as likely to develop Crohn's than non-smokers). ",2

"I am 20, soon to be 21 and I just cannot handle life. I have been sleeping a lot lately. I go to bed at around 10 pm, wake up at 8 am and then go back to sleep at around 11 am or 12 pm. I then sleep until about 3 to 4 pm, and then the cycle continues. I have barely any money left and I am relying on selling some of my belongings in order to get money for my phone bills and food. I quit my last job due to the fact that I just did not have it in me to continue working in that environment: in an environment in which I felt like I was treated lower than everyone else working there. They did say that I was a good fit for the job, but I have a feeling they were lying, or they did not talk to the manager that oversaw my tasks at work, who I am pretty sure thought I was an idiot.. I am starting to believe him. At one point, it was functioning depression, but its not anymore. I eat poorly because of my depression: I eat way too much food: especially bad food. I went into town yesterday to get my meds, which only took about 2 hours. I came back and I was exhausted. It makes me think how I was even able to keep a job in the first place, if I cannot even go into town to get meds without being tired and fed up with life. The meds in question are anti-psychotics and anti depressants, since I hear voices and have delusions from time to time and have depression. Besides that, I have a hard time being a ""responsible"" adult. I put things off either because I am too scared of the outcome, or I just do not care enough to do it. I have been taking my meds on time and they helped for a while, but they do not help anymore. I just do not have the energy or the care to keep going with this life anymore. Sad part is, is that my life is not even that hard. I cannot handle life",1
"Apologies for length. there is a *lot* to explain and I just.. need to vent, need a hug, and need someone to tell me things will be okay.I miss my friends ***so*** much.I met them a few years ago, when we started spending every Wednesday night at each others' places, seeing each others' faces, laughing, drinking, just.. basking in each others' warmth. And they made me feel that I was understood. That I finally had a space with them to be myself. They made me feel like I was *worth* something. Starting March of last year, we had to stop getting together for the then-foreseeable future, for obvious reasons. We still talked to each other every Weds night with voice chat, played games with each other, all of that. We did not stop being friends. Honestly, I do not know what shape I or they would be in if we had not had that solution. It was the best anyone could have done.But.. well.I do not.. love myself very much. Hardly at all, really.it is genetics. I have major depression and anxiety from my mom and dad. I have ASD (formerly Asperger's). And I have been told by my family that even very early on, I was withdrawn from and overwhelmed by the world. I had trouble trying to accomplish things, because I was convinced it would only end in failure.it is also trauma. My mother ran away from the family for a month or two when I was a toddler. Her emotions were unstable and I had to learn to walk on eggshells and preempt her anger or disappointment by treating her well. My dad struggled with alcoholism (though does not anymore) and got in accidents. My parents had lots of shouting matches. I was molested by two separate neighbors when I was 7 or 8. At 14 I was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes after struggling with nausea, headaches, and spontaneous bedwetting (which certainly did not help my middle-schooler dignity) for months. Shortly after that diagnosis, my parents divorced. For years after, I had to act as their intermediary, which was extremely stressful since I feared both of them for different reasons. And so on. And so on. ^((For the record, my relationship with both of my parents is much,) *^(much)* ^(better today. they have owned up to their mistakes and are better people now.))I think all of that has taught me that I am not worth loving. That others matter more. That I am best served by making others happy.When my friends and I had to stop seeing each other, I did not lose them. But.. I think I did lose some parts of those relationships -- faces to read, positions relative to one another in physical space -- that provided me with a sense of worthiness and validation that I otherwise.. was not capable of providing myself.Over the course of Covid, we continued to have voice chats and play games together on Wednesday nights. But I began to act differently. I started going on about how lonely I was. Even right after those nights, on my private twt account (which they all followed), I made those sorts of comments. About how sad and hopeless I was. Almost as if I were accusing them of not doing enough, when in reality we were doing all we could and all we would ever agreed to do.When I saw them sometimes get together online without me, I reacted in similar ways. Even though some of them had been friends before I ever entered the picture. Even though their hanging out outside of the group's Wednesdays had nothing to do with excluding me and everything to do with them being good friends with each other.Throughout all of this, I was feeling down about my job. I would been there for more than six years, but my pay had hardly gotten any higher, and Covid reduced the in-office staff (which I was a part of) to a skeleton crew. I hardly spoke a word to anyone over the course of a day anymore, because there just were not many people to speak words to. I was losing motivation and hope.In April of this year, I applied for a new job that paid better and looked doable, and received a response and interview very quickly. This should have been a red flag, but I ended up accepting the role and giving my two weeks' notice.The week I was to start this new job, I had two more days at the old position to train my replacement. But.. I would never trained anyone before. And we did not have any training resources to speak of. And the senior staff were still almost never in. And my coworker very plainly stated that they did not want to help with the training. And after two hours with the new hire, I would exhausted what little I would been able to prepare. And I excused myself to the bathroom. And I excused myself from the building. And I had a panic attack up the car garage elevator. And I went home and tried to sleep and tried to ignore my phone and continued to panic.And then I started in the new job. And while I understood the role to be clerical, the first half of the day was warehouse work. And I was horrified that I would been placed in the wrong position. The second half of the day, once the financial controller was able to get away from their desk, was indeed training on the clerical role. But it was so nuanced, and touched on so many points so randomly.. and the building was scary, clearly built for a staff of a couple dozen but currently hosting only four, including the owner..For a week this carried on, and I panicked and had sobbing fits and thoughts of self-harm / s\*\*c\*de every single night. I would never experienced anything like it before.After that week, and after discussing it with friends and family.. I resigned. It was just affecting me so dramatically that continuing on was not an option.While this was going on, I asked my friends for support and advice, which they graciously gave me. But I was also.. up at odd hours, especially once I would resigned, continuing to panic. And I poked at my friends. Asked them for more attention and support than they would already given. More than they could reasonably give. I gave them stupid little updates on my state of mind. It was the sort of behavior I would been engaging in with them for a while now, amped up to 200.And it broke. And they told me how I was being. That I was triggering them with my behavior. That I was piling way, way too much onto them.And I felt awful. I would never meant to hurt them. They mattered so, so much to me, and I was being shitty. Emotionally manipulative. I think I loved myself so little that I was trying to get *all* of my validation and comfort from them, especially at my most desperate.. and a person cannot give that much to you. it is not physically or emotionally possible. So.. I spoke to them in voice chat. Apologized. They took my apology, and asked me to move on and be better.So. that is what I have been doing. I started therapy. Started learning to be more self-reliant. To love myself more, because I wanted to be a better friend, and because in the times I would not be able to receive love from them, I would be able to get it from *some*where. To not doubt myself so much. And, by extension, to not doubt my friends (and how their behavior was or was not connected to me / my self-worth) so much. To fight against intrusive thoughts of my worthlessness. To be my own friend.I have had some success. I have made some steps. I am proud of what I have accomplished, even if it is only been a short while. I am definitely in a better place than I was two or three months ago.But.I still miss my friends' faces and places and laughing and drinking and warmth. Because regardless of my own strength, they give me.. tons more. And because I love them and their personalities and just being with them and sharing with them.And recently two of them said they are going to be so busy these next two weeks that they will not even be able to voice chat like normal, and. I am just scared and lonely.And my birthday's at the end of the month, and I am worried I will be spending it alone. They all have spouses, but all I have got is me. And while I am more comfortable with that today, it is still.. not much yet. And I.. want to be happy. I want a happy birthday. I have been so sad with very little break for months and months now. I want my friends back. I want to be happy. And maybe it is childish but I just want someone to hug me and tell me it is going to be okay.If you have.. any kind words, or anything, I would really appreciate it. I really am doing better than I was, but that does not mean I do not stumble, and I am struggling right now.Regardless, thank you for reading all of this. Because of my behavior over the past year, it would not be right to bring up every detail of this with my friend group. But I still want someone to see it.Thank you.

"65mg of elemental iron a day for the last week in preparation for donating blood. Now I’m worried that I’m gonna die from iron toxicity. I’m a 20 year old female who typically has lower than normal iron. Not concerningly low, just on the low end of average. Our college is hosting a blood drive in a few days so I bought some iron supplements about a week ago because I once told the nurse that I’m often rejected due to low iron and the nurse said that a lot of people take iron supplements about a week before they donate. Well the supplements I bought are 65mg of elemental iron per pill. I started taking them before researching a safe dose because I didn’t think you could OD on iron (yes very dumb). After taking one pill a day for about a week I found out that the maximum safe dosage before toxicity occurs is 45mg a day. So now I’m worried that I’m going to die of iron toxicity",2

"I have always been prone to catastrophizing and only ever anticipating the worst. Last year, I had attempted suicide and wound up in a coma for two days. But lately, I have been feeling like I cannot understand why I would do that. I am excited about where life can take me and when I deal with something tough I feel this trust that it will resolve itself. I have been raised within a fundamental Christian household and been taught that only people with faith can achieve such a mindset and religion has always made me unhappy and that inadvertently felt guilt for that. I was in an unhealthy relationship back then and I felt like I really did not know who I was outside of that relationship. I have always wanted that mans validation and he dumped I remember hurting but since that relationship ended I have been making connections that have made me feel whole and I have come to accept that people come and go and I am completely okay with that. It felt like the past years have been completely traumatic and strangely enough I have been thinking about changing my name because I feel like my birth name is loaded with so much trauma I want treat that person like its someone else. I have been feeling this way more recently, I do not want my trauma to influence my decision, I just want to experience life as a new person. Is it optimism or denial",1
"Too much is going wrong and I do not know how much more I can take. I am at work and I just want to go cry in the bathroom because I cannot stop thinking about how am I going to solve these issues. For starters, I just discovered we have bed bugs and I am trying to figure out when I will have time to stop this infestation and being eaten alive at night. I work ten hour shifts usually six days a week and that uses up all of my mental energy for the day. My bank credit card effed up my autopay and charged the wrong card, one I do not use anymore, despite me putting in the new info multiple times and choosing it as my payment method so my payments and APR went through the roof after multiple return payments, late fees, and overdrafts from that bank card. I tried to bandage this situation by doing a balance transfer to another card but for some reason the transfer went through twice which doubled the balance. Both companies are basically telling me the balance transfer transaction is closed so there is nothing I can do...My boyfriend said I was lazy this morning and that really hurt... I know I am not the neatest, I really want to clean and have a neat apartment, but I just can never find the motivation to get up and start cleaning. I just want to be off my aching feet when I get home from work and enjoy what little time I have forgetting the world on my PC til it is time to go to sleep and do it all over again..Our dryer went out and so laundry is piling up. we have only had this dryer for like two months. it is still under warranty and they looked at it over a week ago and said they had to order a part. It should have come by now. Every time we try to call the repair guy he has a full mailbox. I have neither the time, money, nor emotional energy to lug this shit to the laundromat. I am tired of working so much and still being broke. I do not really mind work overall, but it just sucks to work so much and still have no money left over. I am doing my best not to cry as I type this at work so I do not look like a fool in front of my coworkers.. I am sorry. It just feels so overwhelming today... I do not know what to do... I feel so overwhelmed today...",1

"If you are in a bad headspace please do not read this.I [22M] am slowly starting to give up on life. I hoped things would get better but they have not and do not show any signs of changing. I am currently living at home with my verbally abusive mother in a very toxic environment. I want to move out aspa, but I am working a sh*tty job that does not pay well and if I do save up enough. I would be broke for the foreseeable future. I have seen so many CV councillors and applied to so many jobs, and despite all of that I have not been offered any interviews.To sum up my love life, it has been pain. I have never had a partner or anything like that. Every now and again I match with someone we vibe and hit things off, but after a date or two I get ghosted, leaving me confused and hurt as to why they lost interest. I feel undesirable and unworthy of love. I feel like I need to be perfect in every way order to even be considered as a romatic partner. I feel the same way when it comes to job applications. it is mentally taxing and painful.All of this is having a massive effect on my mental health and I am noticing it deteriorating quickly. I hate that I am thinking about just ending it. But I guess I need to know when to quit, I have struggled with knowing when to quit all my life. I guess I was always the hopeful optimist. But what is the point in trying when put all my efforts in trying to make my life better and I still end up in the same place. I keep telling myself be strong, I hype myself up into a positive mindset and a good mood and for what? Nothing seems to change, well nothing permanent. The cycle continues. It feels like everything is working against me, and simple things that should be straight forward are not.And I get life's not fair and I accept that, but it feels like the difficulty was dailed up to 1000 for me. I do not think anyone can save or help me. I have prayed and begged to whatever cosmic being might be out there. Praying for them to give me a break, give me a win, on which I can build on and make my life better. I do not know what I did to deserve this, whether is this life or past or whatever but I am sorry.I have got so much unresolved pain.I know life has it is rough patches but I would at least like some level of happiness. It seems like life is moving by and I am still trying to fight my demons and move forwards.Honestly I am hesitant to kill myself but at the same time I am looking for a happy accident to relieve me of this pain. All I know is, the longer I stay at home and working at the same job, the closer I am to an early grave.I do not know how anyone would be able to help my situation and I do not know what to expect from writing this Reddit post but I need to let it out. Life is painful and I am tired of fighting",1

"Pilonidal cyst not responding to anti biotics ugh. I've had this thing for a while but when it flares up its never THAT bad. This time it was pretty painful and didn't go away after 2 days like it usually does. I went to the dermatologist, he gave me anti biotics. Its been 2 days with the anti biotics (ciprofloxacin) and its still inflamed, arguably worse than ever. Ibuprofen helps but not enough. Sleeping is so god damn difficult. 

The dermatologist said that these things can go 'deep' which scared the shit out of me. I've let this thing just sort of stay there for years now and I am terrified that a surgery would basically take a huge chunk of the entire area out just to get rid of this thing. I actually had a surgery for it years ago but that was when it FIRST appeared, and that was bad enough. 

I hate this so fucking much. I can barely sit down, but standing hurts too for some reason, and so does laying down. ",2

"Hello. r/depression Expect some incoherence, here. I have had a 40. I will try and cover all the bases: career, love, relationships in general, self-esteem/worth. I will be 40, this year. I am graduating with a worthless Bachelor's in CIS this month. I recently moved to be closer with and provide a home for my daughter who is in the military. My boss loves me, my boss's boss loves me. My daughter loves me. I tried going on BetterHelp but, it is too expensive. I am intelligent, articulate, and charismatic. I am also, probably suffering from CPTSD...maybe...Without a real diagnosis, you have to calculate these things indirectly; kind of like an astronomer measures the distance between stars. So if we measure all the ""giftedness"" I had as a child and compare that to the actual output, setbacks, and emotional outbursts I have had in adulthood we can, maybe, probably say I am guessing the right sport...even if I am not in the ballpark. Anyways, I used to feel something. I used to have euphoria almost everyday. I was working out and eating healthy. I was attractive and I had a sex drive. I felt hopeful and motivated. I had a much stronger sense of self worth pursuing my degree than I feel on the verge of achieving it. The key, back then, was that I had a sense of purpose. I felt that the world wanted me, even needed me and that I would offer up my contribution as a good and kind friend, as a supportive coworker, as a loving and kind mother, as an educated and ""gifted"" woman.I do not feel hope. My dumb ass pursued work in a field that is demand is decreasing. I am alone in a city and state that I abhor. I am too old to seek out friends and I have been alone for so long that I am just fucking weird in public. At least, I feel that way. what is worse is, in spite of feeling sadness, I feel hollow. I am sad because I do not feel the actual sadness. I never understood how people become entitled ""incels""; how they will not just get in the problem and do the emotional work and the physical work to get themselves out of their heads. Well, I think I know why, now. Sometimes, some people do not have access to their creative reasoning. Some people do not have access to their visual mind and literally cannot see a way. Some people cannot access the core emotion that drives them and pushes them to move forward. I have, somehow, become one of those people. I feel owed something for all my years of work. I am creeping ever closer to my sense of insignificance in this world; how plain an lackluster I truly am and I am acting out in stupid, uppity ways. I drink nearly every day. I used to drink occasionally in a year. I want to take up smoking again. Addictions used to scare me but, with the ever increasing sense of doom and hopelessness I have, any dirty spot under a bridge somewhere, homeless and single minded, feels like the right space to be in. Tomorrow, I am going to do a thing that is always worked for me in the past. I am going to make myself suffer. I am going to cut off YouTube, Reddit, and Facebook. I am going to wake up early and exercise and study and read and force the world into slow motion. I am going to let go of the beer and sugar and flood my body with veggies all day. I am going to meditate. I am going to relinquish my idea of who I am and what I am worth and set long term goals but, force myself to have short sight that only encompasses being in this moment doing as much as I possibly can to exceed my own expectations. This used to work. It has worked every single time in the past. I hope I have not squeezed the magic out of it by allowing myself to repeat this cycle. No one owes me anything. I do not owe anybody anything. I am curious to know what I am capable of and what I look like as my very best version of myself; this takes embracing every moment with enthusiasm and without judgement. If I were the best version of myself I would take the energy I use to fight moments I am not comfortable with and use it to express some greatness from within. I should not wish for good days. I should strive to be good to my day. So, now that I have spoken to a bunch of strangers who probably will not read this goddamn mess. I have a sense of how to go about this. Thank you reddit for having this thread. I know I have broken a rule because I have not really asked for anything but, I mean...I kind of just am asking to be witnessed. I think. Would you please be a witness to this terribly painful moment in my life? Feel nothing's worse than feeling misery",1

"I was telling them how nervous I am feeling now that my work is talking about WFH privileges ending in a few of weeks due to Covid restrictions ending. They asked me why I would not be happy to be in the office again and I told them that I have always been bullied at school or work and so I just want to do my work and not socialise or whatever. I just want to do my task earn my pay and then enjoy my free time. I really like WFH, wearing a mask to hide my face and people keeping a distance I never want those things to end. I do not have any other friends but I am ok with it as I have given it a try and been hurt and let down so I am quite content just being at home on my own.they have never judged me before and I thought they understood how years of pain has made me wary of other human beings but today they said you are on a path to loneliness and they looked at me as if they were so disappointed in me and maybe not even like me anymore. Now I do not think I will tell them anything ever again. My worries and thoughts will be locked inside my head now forever. The one person I felt safe to share things with has now lost that trust.",1

"really feel like my therapy is not working out. I am not sure if I am the one in the wrong, and I am trying to look at it from all perspectives, so please help me out. I have been with this therapist since february 2020, almost a year and a half. I am a minor and did not want to go to therapy but after being baker acted for a suicide attempt my parents forced me to start with this new therapist. i immediately told my parents i did not like her and i wanted to switch. they did not listen. in the past year and a half i have begged so many times and they refuse to let me switch. they say she has worked with hundreds of kids and is the best in the city. after a year and a half, i am so so so much worse, and while i do not at all blame her for that because that is mostly due to myself and my mental illness, she has offered no help or support at all and has only made me feel worse. i have never felt like we clicked, i feel like she does not understand what I am trying to say. i talk about myself and how i feel and she tells me i am wrong. ljke she is telling me how she thinks i feel instead of listening to me talk. she constantly gets mad at me for not trying hard enough even though i have repeatedly told her that it is hard for me. i struggle with social anxiety so it is hard for me to open up to strangers. she often asks me if there is anything i would like to talk about and then gets mad at me when i say no, even though i have told her i am too anxious to bring my own subjects to talk about. i feel scared about saying the wrong things to her because of how she will react. if she deems that I am not trying hard enough she gets my parents involved and tells them to be very strict with me, even though she knows that we do not have the best relationship and in the past it has only made things worse. i finish all my homework with maximum effort and she still complains that I am not trying. if she does not think I am trying she calls me spoiled and selfish because I am not using the resources I am given which i totally understand that I am very lucky to have parents that can afford and care enough to put me in therapy, but being called spoiled and selfish for not trying even though i am just sends me into a downward spiral of self hatred and makes my depression so much worse. when i tell her about my suicidal thoughts she says I am just glamourizing/ glorifying death and that i think its cool. which is rlly invalidating because she is basically saying I am suicidal for attention and because i think its cool. and when i try to calmly explain that i do not at all think its cool, but i feel so trapped that i do not see any other way out and I am in so much unbearable pain that i cannot survive anymore she tells me no i think you are just glamorizing it which upsets me further. she tells me to choose happiness which again, i get where she is coming from because i know that choosing to have a positive mindset is important to beating depression, but i tell her that its rlly hard for me because no matter how hard i try to be happy i end up even more miserable, she tells me that its my fault for not trying hard enough and that if i wanted to be positive and happy i would. she constantly points out my flaws and not in a therapeutic way. like when she starts session she always says hey how are you and i said I am good, how are you to be polite she says ugh that is not what you are supposed to say you have to tell me how your week was, this is why i say you do not even try. if you keep this up I am going to have to tell your parents you are not trying. also, the thing that is currently bothering me the most is her trying to discuss a disorder. now firstly, when she brought it up she said i could reject the diagnosis (non-verbal learning disorder). she told my mom and some teachers too to get multiple perspectives. everyone she talked to (parents, teachers, etc) said that it does not sound like me at all and i meet none of the criteria. i talked to her about it and said hey i really do not feel like i fit this at all, but I am open to the diagnosis and would love to hear why you think i have this. if i have NVLD i would love to be diagnosed and get treatment but i do not want to be misdiagnosed especially because no one who knows me thinks i have the symptoms. so i tried to listen to her with an open mind but the things she said were complete bullshit. like she went over the symptoms list and just said completely false things (like things that just never happened) and refused to listen when i told her that is not what happened for example, last november i was at rock bottom, so suicidal and was failing out of school, so my parents switched me to a small private school with ten kids in my grade. i was so so so angry at them. also, on top of this the kids were actually insane (on my first day there one of them lied about being in sandy hook and another followed me through the parking garage). anyways, i was very angry and sad so instead of hanging out with the other kids during lunch break, i went up to the pharmacy and bought bottles of pills so i could try to kill myself. i spent most of my lunch breaks loooking for ways or places to kill myself because my family was being very unsupportive and i was not allowed to see my friends and i was going through so much. anyways, my therapist brought this up. and she said kids with NVLD often are loners or isolate themselves and are socially awkward. you going off on your own during lunch shows this behavior.l and i said i was literally trying to KILL MYSELF how are you going to use that as an example??! and she was like i think its fair to use that as evidence you have NVLD and all of her examples were like this!! and i was like there is literally no solid evidence and no one else who ACTUALLY KNOWS ME thinks i have this disorder its complete bullshit if you have real reasons fine but its not fair to use lies to make this claim instead of listening to me. i just feel like it would be way more helpful and productive if i could explain how my brain works and how i interpret things and she tells me if that aligns with NVLD. but when i try that she says yeah that does not seem like NVLD but i still think you have it. like when she asks me a question and i say i do not know because i do not like being put on the spot she says that that is not understanding broad concepts so i automatically have NVLD. its just so frustrating. i told her I have done so much research and watched so many videos about people talking about their experiences with NVLD and how it affects them and i relate to NONE OF IT and she does not listen. my mom has done the same thing and says she does not see how it relates to me because I am good at reading social cues, knowing what to say, am good at making friends, grasp concepts well, etc. it makes me really mad that she refuses to listen. she makes me feel so horrible about myself. every session with her makes me hate her and hate myself. I have begged my parents to quit and they will not let me. idk what to do. am i in the wrong (therapy)?",1
"Crippling new job anxiety Hi all,

I’ve started a new job about 2 weeks ago, it’s a higher paying customer care job for an insurance company. I was in retail for 5 years and incredibly comfortable in my position. It’s a work from home role, I needed something different as retail was driving me up the wall, and I can put on a damn good customer service facade. 

Anyway, today I’ve been taking calls and all of a sudden, became overwhelmed with everything and burst into tears. I cried during a call, and could not stop crying until I logged out. I’ve spent the entire evening on the phone to my parents crying and crying to my partner. I’m dreading doing it again. I was ready to quit.

How do you deal with this? I’m breathing, taking my meds, eating well and drinking well. My brain is causing problems out of nothing and I’ve been making myself sick over this job. Anyone dealt with this in their new job and how did you overcome it?",2
"Smaller stomach after hernia repair surgery [Help] Hello,i am a 19 yo rather healthy female and i have underwent a hernia repair surgery a month ago.Im roughly around 66kg and 176cm tall.

my ex broke up w me almost 3 weeks ago. i blamed her for feeling insecure. i didnt know that what i was doing was trying to restrict her from opening up to other people. i asked her if we could keep our problems to ourselves because people might think differently of us. i told her that because she opened up to our friend and that friend told the story to our other friends, and so they were laughing about it. i didnt like it so i opened up to her regarding that. she said she opened up to our friend because it was too heavy on her. she cant handle it. i wasnt there to comfort her that time when were having an argument coz i told her i dont wanna talk and i just wanna cool my head first. i was so self centered. i realized how selfish i am. like instead of understanding why she opened up to our friend instead just let my insecurities take over me.

I just do not know what to do anymore, on top of all that i suffer from depression and anxiety and bpd and an ed. its just so hard and now i have to work all the time so i can afford my own apartment because my grandma is selling the house in a few months and already found a new place. (cannot move in with her because she is living somewhere for the elderly) i just feel like complete shit right now, I am not going to kill myself but damn i truly never expected my life to be this fucking bad. i just have nobody except one friend but i do not want to rant to them all the time, I am sure it gets very annoying. well i have to work early tmr so imma end this here, thank you if you read this far. and if you did not, well I am really not surprised like I am literally being that bitch that just trauma dumps but i just cannot hold shit in much longer.

"I want my old self back I have had countless changes in my life and came in terms with at some point....but I myself changed, a lot. Not in a good way. That's what I'll never recover from.

I wasn't the best with emotions of people that time but atleast I was happy and functional. I have tied my worth to a lot of things which I no longer have. That, made me question worth relentlessly. I think everyone deserves to be happy despite everything in life, but I can't say it to myself. All conditions are different for myself. I deserve to starve if I don't do well, I deserve to not meet anyone if I messed up somewhere, I deserve to be treated like shit. 

It took me a while to realise how I came to accept being treated badly by people. I am ""working on myself"" but will I ever be able to get my old self back? No. I'm stuck with a version of myself who cares about everything except herself and it fucking sucks.",1

I posted this on multiple threads. I hope it can help someone.Hi!I just wanted to share a book that really helped me on my journey with depression and anxiety. I think it is a must read. I even recommended it to my therapist and she went out and bought it. it is called the mood cure by Julia Ross. It explains the physical aspects of depression and anxiety in your body. It shows you natural supplements you can take if you do not want to go down the medication route. It even has a quiz to determine what type of depression you have. Hope this helps! A book that changed my life and taught me about depression and anxiety [Tip],1
@BMkerchief I love each time up post an update. Ur profile picture is an amazing site let me tell u!,0
"New Here Unfortunately Hi all. I am new to this forum and thought I might gain some reassurance from others who are having the same issues as myself. 

The last year or so has been filled with a few periods of time in which my health anxiety peaked. This often left me confused and helpless. Everything I feel or see makes me question if I am becoming seriously ill in some way. 

About 3 years ago I had my first issue with HA. I was having chest pains while playing baseball at school. I actually ended up going to the hospital for this and had an ECG. I was told that my heart was fine and it may just be growing pains as I was about 14 at the time. 

The next problem was where it really started to get much worse. About a year ago while showering I noticed a light brown spot (which was probably just a stain or dirt of some sort) on my foot sole. I could not stop thinking about this and was constantly measuring and photographing the spot to make sure it didn’t grow. I couldn’t help but to think this was melanoma. The dot eventually disappeared on its own after about 2-3 weeks. 

Next came issues of tingling in feet and hands. Being like I am, I did the worst thing you could probably do which was google it. Of course it is a symptom of diabetes. I now constantly feel what I believe to be different symptoms happening each day. Each symptom I hear of miraculously occurs the next day. In fact, I feel as if my vision is becoming blurred (another symptom of diabetes) as I type this. 

I know these symptoms appearing just after I learn of them is just my mind messing with me. Does anyone have any advice on how they were able to cope with these underlying thoughts? ",2

"It helps with the physical symptoms, such as palpatations and elevated heart rate. However I still have attacks that force me to lay down alone for 30 minutes or more, sometimes hours. I have random pains all the time, my arm, leg, chest, stomach, headaches, etc. Constant health anxiety too, I get one mild headache and think I have meningitis or a brain tumor, etc. Well I had a checkup with him today and asked him about medicine I could use PRN.",3
"Chewed tobacco over the weekend. Anxiety going crazy Kinda like the title says, but I chewed tobacco this weekend. I was with a friend on vacation and while drunk, I packed a few dips. I don't normally chew, and the total times I have done it in my life are in the single digits.

But I got a small canker sore from it, and it is driving my anxiety crazy thinking I have cancer. Lesson learned: Not worth doing it cause it will drive my anxiety crazy. ",2

"I do have intense anxiety to the point it affects my daily life and prevents me from performing the smallest tasks such as making a phone call to get an appointment. However, I do not know if my anxiety is a result from what had happened to me as a child or me experiencing unpleasant experiences in highschool. I just know that my rape makes my anxiety worse sometimes. I do get triggered by anything that reminds me of unpleasant memories of my rape. The only time I break down is when I am severely distressed or my feelings are so bottled up that a trigger would set me off crying.",3

"Reflecting on where I was five years ago to now I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7ykd0j/just_thinking_about_life/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) five years ago about some thoughts I had at the time. Reflecting back on them, I'm surprised with how articulate my thoughts were back then. More importantly, the feelings I harbored have changed for the worse. 

I'm still naïve to the adult world. I'm only 27, but I've lost all my innocence by this point. I think the hardest thing to do as an adult is maintain friendships and socialize. Even working was easier for me. I still consider myself a failure in this all, and I've lost hope by this point in any personal success. It's no longer fine.

I've stopped paying attention to the world outside. It's still broken, and I've no hope that it will be in a better state in the future. People will struggle at one point or another, for varied lengths of time. I'm still struggling.

I'm still a kid who never grew up. I'm immature. I'm not smart. I'm not capable of great things. I've wasted too much time thinking about useless things like what the future may hold and what purpose I have in this world. This reality truly is tiring. 

I still don't believe this reality is for me. I'm not fine. I've not been fine this whole time, even though I've been doing my best to get through it all. I still see suicide as my only way out and still struggle with ideation, fearing that I won't be able to integrate into society like a normal person. I'm still afraid to go through with suicide, even though I'm physically hurting almost every day from living, and I don't think I'll ever be able to go through with suicide because of that fear. I will forever be trapped here until I die from natural causes or an accident.

It's become more difficult to live, and I expect it to be even more difficult as time moves on. I find it hard to get out of bed until hours later where I feel regretful for staying in bed for too long. I don't have the motivation or strength to do things that would benefit me, like showering consistently, cleaning, or eating meals. I can't even push myself to find work. I feel bad for telling people this stuff, and I don't trust any professionals with this either. I want to improve, but I lose motivation easily. I don't have anyone or a support group to keep me on my feet. I can't do this by myself. I don't know what to do next to make things better for myself.",1

I bought an expensive gym membership for me and my mom. They have a jacuzzi and large swimming pool. She will promise to go with me but whenever that day comes she always says she is tired...every single time. I think before the pandemic we have only been to the gym twice together altogether out of my 3 year membership. She will not go with me. I wish I had someone to go with but I do not :/. I have 0 friends. Guess I will go by myself. Going by myself is so awful. I see everyone else with their friend/partner and me... all alone.. I have went to the movies by myself too because she did not want to go. Someone even asked me in the movie theater what is a young girl (I am 21) like me doing alone :/ Wish I had someone to do things with :/,1

I started feeling like I was having a panic attack and removed the bib from my neck, put on my coat and bolted to my car. I still feel shaky now. Idk what's wrong with me.

I am a 22 year old girl struggling to find hope. I wish I could extract everything in my brain and export it onto this Reddit post instead of having to type out and remind myself of why I feel like this but I’m hoping I’ll only have to do this once.
You know, I try really fucking hard. I practice gratitude whenever I can. Everyday I wake up and I journal. I tell myself I’m grateful I am healthy, that I have both my legs and both my arms attached, that I have a roof over my head, that I have 20/20 vision, that I have a heart that beats.. and so on. You get the point. I try and I romanticize my life. I try and enjoy my morning coffee extra hard, I try and be present, I try to enjoy the mundane things about life just as much as the big extravagant things. 
But the truth is, My first distinctive memory is disassociating for the first time when I was 5 years old. I remember zoning out because of the fights that would go on at home. I remember being depressed before the word depressed was ever even introduced to me. I felt like a zombie as a child, I felt like i was always  outside of my body looking in. I felt different. Like my soul was not meant to be here. I lived my life very alone, I never had anybody and I filled the voids through whatever caught my attention. In the end we all day. Why are we here? What’s our purpose? In the grand scheme of things nothing matters. Really, nothing matters. The world would be okay without me.What’s funny is to others I am a bubbly sweet kind happy girl. People would be shocked to see this side of me. I’ve tried. I hope that is evident. I just think the more you know about life, the more you’ve been through, the more you realize how meaningless all this is.. is what makes you detach and unhappy.",1

I could not focus, was always procrastinating, could not find any real joy. Got admitted to a mental hospital, and then transferred my senior year. It was awful. I felt so out of place. The work was not hard to understand, i just could not get in the right headspace to do it. Come to find out, it was ADHD (well, i will not get the official yay or nay until the 2nd).Graduated with a 3.6 weighted, did not study for my ACT got a 27, not many extracurriculars and I want to learn from my mistakes and do better.

Now the little one'e cat parents will be here any moment and I feel like I have let them down.Why was I so stupid that I could not do anything to save the kitten. Just when the little one was warming up to us, I betrayed its trust. I feel terrible and horrible. I am in tears right now, I am never going to be able to forgive myself ever in my life. I am unable to forgive myself",1
"Hey you all, I am writing this from bed haha. I am currently recovering from insomnia and my sleep is just about ok now, but now I am just kind of depressed still. Some days Ill feel ok now which is great but on days like today I just have no energy or drive, then I get sad because I cannot do much. I am also still in bed for 10-11 hours a day which sucks too. I keep making progress slowly but I guess I am wondering if the energy thing is similar for anyone else. Thanks! Some days I am just so damn tired",1
"I have troubles discovering something, starting it and keeping doing it.

"I do not show it when I am out, but today I came home and my shoes were dirty. I got ridiculously angry and starting tearing up. I was actually having a good day, was not sad, but I keep like I have this tension I have to release. Its like I have energy. I guess Ill mention I was fasting, but I just ate and I am not angry anymore but I still feel this sort of tension I have to release. This is one of the main reasons why I binge eat, I get this adrenaline I need to release and my day just seems way too boring. I do not understand, sometimes I so irritable for no reason? Like even if I am having a good day. Fasting is supposed to make you feel good, I was having a good day, felt pretty, but then I get into these angry/sad moods where I just want to scream at everyone? I am able to hide it at work but I get so angry over stupid things and I just do not get it. I still sorta feel it, I do not know if its like, sadness, arousal. I just have this tension I need to let out!Could it be bipolar? Adhd? I have heard of BPD but I feel like that is the same at bipolar. Idk I do not think I just have depression because I have lots of happy moments but then fall into sadness. A lot of it comes from my eating disorder. Opinions? Super angry and little things?",1
"The person needs to have in some manner lived out these fantasies, for example via an ongoing sexual relationship with a child. The person is atleast 16 years of age and atleast 5 years older than the child. I was 13 when this happened, had more or less *just* entered puberty, she was 19, and more than 5 years older. Was this abuse? Were I abused as a child?",0
"Don't know if I legitimately messed up my neck or if the stress is making it this way For the past 3 weeks, I've had stiffness and discomfort in my neck. For the first 2 weeks, I'm pretty sure it was a legitimate issue of carrying heavy bags on my shoulders while traveling. It started to feel better but then I felt the back of my neck with my hand and I noticed a hard lump where my skull meets my neck. It seems reasonable that it would be my spine but I've never felt it before now and it's close to the surface and large. It seriously freaked me out and now I can't stop messing with my neck and pushing on it. It is now stiff again and hurts. I convinced it was my own fault from messing with it and being super stressed out again. But this morning I also noticed that when I move my head side to side in a certain position, there is a crunching sound that almost sounds like sand grinding. It makes my head and neck feel almost dizzy but seriously uncomfortable. I don't know if that is real or anxiety. I'm going to the doctor on Monday but I'm afraid they won't take me seriously, but I think I may have legitimately messed something up I. my neck. I'm young and this came on rapidly so I don't know if I screwed it up from traveling or what. But I'm seriously scared since it's near my spinal cord and I will go paralyzed or have to get surgery. Has anyone dealt with this? ""Crunching/sand sound in neck"" seems to be a common Google search but no satisfying answers.",2

"People often say “Really?” when I tell them I have anxiety, and I have mixed emotions about it. On the one hand, it’s comforting to know that all of my worries about coming across as nervous or awkward are so out of proportion that people don’t even know I have anxiety. 

On the other hand, it feels sort of invalidating to my struggle, if that makes sense. This thing often consumes my life, and it’s frustrating that no one knows how hard I’m trying. They just think this is easy for me, that I can effortlessly raise my hand and speak in class like other people do. That’s not to say that I feel negatively toward the people who say this, more that it’s just generally frustrating that people have no idea. 

Have y’all thought about this too? Do you look at it a different way?",2

i have come to the conclusion that i am just not suited for life no matter how hard i try i don t seem to be able to accomplish anything meaningful or be able to derive joy out of anything i wa given nice parent and a privileged upbringing but the extreme depression that rule my life is overwhelming and i really can not take it anymore i have an easy life and i still can t manage to get it right i started to feel worthless ever since i wa a teenager i had a hard fitting in with group of people i felt extremely shy and i saw that my best friend at the time could effortlessly blend in and have many friend it completely baffled me and it wa the first time that i started telling myself over and over i am not pretty i have no talent i am not smart i am worthless year old me cried myself to sleep convinced that people just simply didn t like me i could never quite figure out what wa defective in me everywhere i went i felt extremely awkward and felt in high school i started to feel immense academic pressure i saw that my classmate were very high achieving i didn t even want to think about my future and i spent much of my time last minute studying and playing video game instead of planning anything for my future i ended up not getting into college that i wanted to while my friend and classmate were accepted i accepted that i wa a failure compared to everyone in my high school a socially awkward talentless ugly failure i went to university i am now doing a master with an internship i graduated with summa cum laude for my undergraduate i wa still constantly cry and contemplating the worth of my pathetic life still i wa able to appear smart in front of my classmate i took up a research internship a well where i wa again told that i wa smart and had a lot of potential and other b but aside from school i didn t have much of a life any friend i made in uni have long been lost because people don t like being around a depressed person i wa made out to be toxic so that alone should tell you enough how awful it is to be around me i went to therapy it didn t do much i took medication it doesn t do much i have now entered my master program and i am being told by my supervisor that she ha serious doubt a to whether i will pas everyone else is enjoying their time in their study while i have to struggle so hard just to be told that i m not even good enough to get a passing grade i also struggle extremely badly with body dysmorphic disorder i have a pear shaped body no matter how much i exercise my leg just stay very bulky and thick i lost a lot of weight in my last year of my undergraduate study it wa partly because i hated my body but above all it wa because i hated my life so much that i wanted to make it visible by appearing sickly thin i continued to lose weight until i wa underweight only then do my leg appear normal i continued to follow disgusting anorexic eating pattern during my study it wa so damn hard to study while having to be pre occupied with food and having to only eat calorie in order to not gain weight somehow i passed all my damn exam after this year i admitted to my parent that i had an eating disorder although at this point it wa kind of evident i went home to take a gap year for the sake of my mental health during my gap year i sought professional treatment and of course i gained a ton of weight i wa so sick of living with severe depression and anorexia it wa near traumatic to see my body change so much in a short amount of time i felt extremely defective for gaining so much weight i can t believe my parent thought it would be a good idea for me to recover at home instead of at a ed treatment center because my emotional volatility were simply insane but i became physically healthy and i wa eating lot of good food i even got a part time job during my gap year to convince myself that i wa at least semi functional unfortunately a is the case with my pear shaped body living at a normal weight entail lot and lot of misery i can never wear skinny jean because my leg are ugly i can t stand the cellulite and belly fat that accompanies my healthy body i wa handed bad genetics in term of body build my body alone take away my will to live after my gap year i continued onto my master i started to lose some weight just because i slept through some snack and meal from fatigue and then i knew that i could never gain that weight back i started to take up lot of exercising to create more room for extra food the vast majority of my classmate are thin people being bigger than everyone is extremely triggering for me everyday i wake up and think about what i m going to eat then i think about how big my leg are then i think about how much thinner and smarter and classmate are then i see all the thin people around me then i think about what i m going to eat next then i think about how i m going to fit a jog or a boxing class into my busy schedule then maybe i will think about school and such then i go to sleep and repeat it all again i even lost my damn period again it s maddening because i am not even a thin person and yet my body think that being slightly thinner mean that i m necessarily dying i have such a dumb body now here i am doing an internship for school and i am failing very badly it s not in my native language and i haven t known the language for very long so it cost me twice the cognitive energy to follow everything apparently taking exam go smoothly but the minute i have to be in a practical setting i turn into a complete idiot i don t have the extra energy to put in the effort because most of my dumb thought are just my leg are fat her leg are thin she is lucky i have to worry about weight lunch is when jogging when extra squat when what s for dinner etc now i m constantly being told that i m not performing well and they can t tell if it s because of a language barrier or if i genuinely don t understand what is going on everyone else is doing just fine and they say that you have to be pretty stupid to fail at this internship well guess who s going to be that idiot who can t pas looking back at my life i just see failure and mediocracy and just a lot of sadness a i said earlier my body alone take away my will to live but in order to be able to function in school and work you need to stay relatively healthy but seeing a my life is just filled with social isolation inferiority complex and still lot of depression there is just simply no way that my life is worth it living in this healthy body make me extremely sad and the life that i would otherwise have without an ed is just not worth it it doesn t justify the effort i put into recovery and the effort i put in with learning to accept my body seeing a my life is just consisting of studying feeling stupid feeling incompetent cry exercising restrictive eating hunger fatigue and more cry i just wonder how the hell everyone else is just out here living a normal life without any mental illness people like my classmate are really out here acing their exam acing their internship having a life having lot of friend having a relationship having fun and leading overall fulfilling life i don t understand it all i know is that my life wa just one big mistake i just really need a good plan on how to end myself i find it disappointing how finding a simple method with a high success rate just isn t very easy i have four more week in my internship i just plan to go through it get an insufficient grade and then end it all but ugh mom and dad would be so sad it s already bad enough that i tell them that i hate living and wish that i could disappear they try so hard to convince me that i m smart and can accomplish anything i want like i m in a disney movie they constantly try to convince me that i will find happiness in my life and that i m just in a low state of my life and that they will always be there and try to find further help for me but i m i ve been feeling this way for over a decade damn near half my dumb existence i feel like my soul died the minute i hit puberty i didn t experience anything traumatic i wa just dealt a bad hand in genetics i m freaking exhausted nothing would be better than closing my eye and never waking up again,1
I am in California. I understand this is legal but of course I am still pissed off. I am wondering how to explain this to my strict family. I am in my 20s and still living at home. Even if no fault means it was not my fault I have a feeling they will not believe me anyway. I know no one here can actually help me but I needed to just share somewhere how pissed I am.I do not think I can count this as getting laid off as they will not even tell me what the fuck happened other than it was at no fault. I just got a phone call from my manager notifying me that they decided to terminate me with no fault or because after only 3 shifts,1

Woke up this morning and felt okay besides my usual chest tightness. But a couple hours later I accidentally pressed on the inside of my thigh and felt the pain so I looked ane there's a little bruise there .. it is probably the size of a nickel or dine and is a bluish color. It hurts when I press on it but otherwise I don't really notice that it's there. However I started freaking out about the possibility of it being a DVT.

"So in my own (subjective) case, I would say it is a fight in and of itself just to recognise that you happen to be feeling the way you are feeling/thinking along the lines you are thinking because you are in a low swing and your entire perception of reality, let alone your judgement, is impaired.My brain has a habit of convincing me that something else is responsible; which usually ends up with me doing something radical like moving house, or even country, or just generally running from a problem I have assigned some imaginary responsibility to for what is, ultimately, probably just a chemical imbalance in my head.*Anyway* what I wanted to ask you guys is, when you get over that first hurdle and manage to sit down and concede ""I am experiencing a depressive mood swing."" How do you deal with it? It does not seem like something you can fight or attempt to deny, yet wallowing is counter-productive.Winston Churchill called it a ""Black Dog"" and I have read that it is useful to think of depression that way - some animal we have to cow or master, but I guess I am wondering more about techniques/your own experiences here?I can say that writing this was certainly helpful, so perhaps it does just come down to being able to articulate the problem? But that is not going to be a catch-all for everyone. What do you guys do when you are aware you are in a low swing? How do you deal with it?",1
so far this year hasn t exactly been easy i ve been out of work cause my grandpa had back pain that he had to get surgery for then he had to be put in the hospital due to internal bleeding then he got diagnosed with cancer then he had to go to the hospital again due to fluid build up and if that weren t enough something happened between my dad and stepmom that had me afraid that they were gon na get a divorce or something thankfully thing had be getting better lately i managed to get an xbox series x my grandpa is out of the hospital and making a lot of progress on regaining his strength thing are now better between my dad and stepmom and a game i ve been eagerly looking forward to tiny tina s wonderland will be releasing this friday however my enthusiasm is starting to rain dramatically now i m getting to the point where i d have to work on final assignment and honestly i m not exactly feeling great about them one for my technical writing class ha so many step and aspect i have to try and think about that even though it s the one that ha me the least worried i feel myself getting depressed thinking about it but a for my maine history class that s the one that really ha me overwhelmed for that i have to write a term paper of at least double spaced page on an issue in maine history not only is that by far the biggest paper i would have to write since 0 0 but it s on a subject that i m seriously not exactly passionate about even though i m from maine i can t exactly think of any big issue in the state s history let alone one s i can write page about the closest thing i thought of is the fact that paleontology is very limited in this state but i m not exactly sure if that subject will fly and i m almost certain that won t be able to turn that into page now i m at the point where i m just absolutely sick of college and what assignment like this keep doing to me and my mental health i swear once i have enough credit for my associate degree i am fucking done with this shit i could keep going for my bachelor s but since i m going part time it will take me another year and i can t stand the idea of having to go through all that for that much longer,1

"Complex I know. I love Reddit, its the last place you think to find support and answers and often the first where you find them. I am 23, since 16 I have been mostly on my own, been good at taking care of myself so family stopped bothering to care for me at 17. They left me alone at 17 for a year in a strange country while I worked 2 full time jobs and had the pressure of perfect grades. All because I wanted that *perfect* life. The fucking American dream hits once again.I do not have many friends, I have never been popular and I felt alone most of my life. Clinged to the first girl that loved me at 16 and ended up with a classic if you leave Ill kill myself she left. And I tried. Not successfully evidently. 20 hits, i move to college, first goal achieved, enter drugs, party and social life. God Weed is like that checkpoint timer in the arcades for me, always giving me and extra 30s of life. Then Acid came, gLucy is so good, in the process I found friends or more like stupid kids that like to do those stupid things too. And I loved it, what else is there? You wake up, eat trashy food, get high, do some more drugs with a group of friends, you all laugh about whatever and suddenly you had the greatest night of your life. But for how long?I was always the last one to stop. The last one at the party. The last one to stop being irresponsible and getting back to my responsibilities. The last one to wake up. And I got dropped from the university. And again, goals. I lied, no one even knew, I took a job, started clases at the community college, got clean from smoking weed daily, doing stupid drugs like acid, coke or combining stuff. Or just the ocasional Monday at 4pm bowl I was used to. And it was good, a girl from this group and I became close, 2 lost souls found purpose: each other. She saves me, I save her. All the while no one is saving anyone really. I got back to school, different attitude, I grew up 3 years in 6 months. I did not want to party because I knew I would end up in that spiral again. I started staying in more and more, forgot about friends and stayed with her. She became the only person in my life. The pandemic helped, what was a choice before became an obligation. We stay in only you and me and we enjoy life. I started smoking again, daily, multiple times. April - May 2020 I do not remember not being high at all. But once I got back to work (oh yeah I had been working full time nights for over a year while going to school) I was able to maintain smoking, working, studying. Barely. But it was functional. I kept losing friends, people became strange for me. I started staying in more and more, but now not even her I would talk to. I would stay quiet, play my game, smoke my weed, watch my movies. And I stopped feeling. I think I watched too many tv shows, the perfect group of friends, living in a big city, challenged through life. This shows are for the Priviledged ones. I never mentioned, all my friends in college. Came from wealthy families, I was the Poor one. No one ever pointed that out, I always felt it. It was like, they had a family backing them, they could be stupid and not worry about food tomorrow. I was the opposite, I resented them, but I wished I could be them. So I adopted their lifestyle and convinced myself I could by my own means put myself in their level. It was a challenge, and it was exciting. My goal was, I graduate, I key a high paying job, I move to a big city. I live the big city life and i become another one, not happy not sad, just another one with a life to carry him over not the other way around. So we set goals, me and her would finish school, get good paying jobs (she is well off and her family can support her so she could afford to pursue her dreams and I always felt I could not) I took for granted that she was going to make it, she was the smart one, the one with the good grades, with the degree. It did not work. She moved back overseas where she came from. I was left alone. So I worked, I did my all to move to the big city. I am here, I have it. The good job, the financial stability, the big city, the opportunities, the freedom to do whatever I want. I feel zero. I feel like nothing ever changed. I feel like I just kept pointlessly reaching for that checkpoint seconds. I just kept adding and adding 30 seconds one at the time. But I have no sense, no purpose, I withdrew from everyone. Everyone is gone, I am nothing but an afterthought. My best friends do not even bother and many of our conversations end with you do whatever you want dude is your life were here for you but I learned that the people who are here for you do not mention it. They just are. Its been a while since I have been suicidal. Before it was an anguish, I wanted to make it stop. Today I do not want that, I want to start it, to feel, to have something happen. I fill my time off work with irrational amounts of drugs. No one even knows, all they think is I smoke but I have about tried anything to make myself *feel* again. I am so forgotten no one noticed when I started buying pills. I could die alone in a city of 3 million people, no family nearby no friend to notice until I am truly gone. If I wanted I could say goodbye tonight, no one to really stop me. However, at the end, all I want, is to get high, feel that soft breeze in my face when your chasing, that brief moment of enjoyment where there is nothing but being relaxed. I could die tonight but All I want is to get high.",1
"I am currently 33, single, on a train towards my mother. I do not have brothers or sisters. Mother is all I have got left.3 months ago, I was abroad, living with my married partner (still married as of 11-07-21, been with her 10 years), and my family. Nice place, fantastic job (I still have, but energy for this dropped to zero), dogs, pets, the whole picture. We had an amazing buffer and had an even greater outlook on the future. We barely fought, perhaps if it had to be steak or chicken for dinner.Now, 3 months later, my wife is (about to be diagnosed) with potentially various mental disorders. Something in her head clicked 3 months ago, slept around, started to drink, smoke, had various physical (yes it started with physical ailments, tachycardia, ovary pain), it all pointed towards potential bipolar and perhaps something else. She overdosed, entered into a psychiatric facility, who said the same, she is bipolar. I look behind her eyes, and there is nothing left of the woman I once met.I went to the doctor, I need help. And he did, extra pills, therapy.In the ten good years I have had with her, we fulfilled the bucket list, financially secure, loving family. We did everything, together. All countries, we tried all drugs, we bought our first car, etc. All shared ""firsts"". The financiall security has diminished as she went into hardcore drugs to mask the mayhem in her brain (she is now on prescribed pills by her shrink) but subsequently were the ones she used for overdose.She feels the entire world is after her, to get her. Her entire group of friends altered, all her previous friends are enemies, the new ones are nothing but codependent enablers who yammer; ""nothing wrong with you girl""An extremely bright person, broke, into a 1000 pieces.I could not focus anymore, work went tits up.I have already achieved everything I wanted, and all I wanted now was to keep what we had. Life is not a rodeo, (i remember I buried my dad), so I was expecting a downturn, but not one like this.I wrote various ""this is it suicide letters to all my friends and loved ones"" for their help over the years and went to a bridge last thursday night. A jump would have done it, not on a car. Minimum impact. i had a list left of people Id call if I would do something this big.one picked up, we talked for 6 hours, following morning doctor, higher dosage.They all understood. Even my mum. All understood, they were respectful. I am walking around with 150% pressure in my head while I can only take 100% daily. I told my friends, and my doctor and therapist. My head is ticking. I can take this another few weeks until I break again. They got it.I am in perfect condition, eat healthy.The overdose, the mourning of what I once had, the ""now what question"" as I already achieved financial and corporate success in my field, and all hobbies I once had are triggers to my past. So obviously I am trying new hobbies, I use the pills, I meet friends, I work out, I still do my job at 25%, I keep swimming.But this is nothing more but a boring equation of, I realize time heals wounds, but if time is 45 days, and I am currently drowning every day, I do not know if I will make it to those 45 days...Any advice? Because this write up was nothing else to waste another +15min to get to that ""time heals wounds"" phase. What to do now?

I have been getting anxiety attacks left and right. I have lost so much. I lost my family on my dad's side. I lost my grandparents and Aunt on my mom's side. I feel like I am losing. My girlfriend I feel like is trying to distance herself from me, but from what I was told she is not. However she wants to be Poly, and idk if I can follow that path without being crushed. Ig I will give it a chance. Maybe that might change. She does not want to lose me, yet I think this is her excuse to get away from me to make it seem harmless. I am losing. I am losing the battle that keeps me alive and I cannot even tell anyone anymore. I am lost. I keep hoping that things will get better, yet no matter where I have turned in my life they never get better. I might be stuck undiagnosed forever. I might have no SO forever. I might not have family that loves me forever.But here I stay... I keep my hopes up, and pray that things will be better when I am an adult. all I have to do is stay hopeful. I guess...

"question regarding fingers slightly moving. Is it normal?

Not sure if I can classify it as 'tremors'

Basically, from what I've seen with different kinds of videos regarding tremors, it doesn't look like it.

Let's say I put my hands in the air facing my palm, or just in the bed resting, it doesn't shake or what.

But sometimes, if I look at them long enough, I notice it they slightly move.

Not sure if I'm doing it voluntarily, I'm being anxious, thus, making it move, or maybe because I'm not used to holding that kind of position, it kinda moves because of it?

If anything, I type a lot in a computer. Upon searching, I've seen that they might just been twitching due to fatigue, so maybe that's what it is?

As much as possible, I don't want to go to a doctor just because of this.

What should I do, there's no way I can cancel it as well. 

What should I do? I cant seem to find the source of my anxiety.",2

"Left pinky finger numb So this is day number 3 and my finger is still numb. I can move it, but I heard that numb fingers or tingling in your left hand can be a sign of a heart attack. The thing is, I went to ER twice and my ECG was good. I have slight tachycardia and I'm not convinced that I'm healthy, despite the doctors telling me everything's fine. Chances are low at 29 and as a woman to get heart issues, but I can't believe that my anxiety is producing all these symptoms. On top of that, I have neck, sternum and back pain and I'm dizzy. My blood pressure is 106/69, but my pulse is always over 80. But the worst part is my hand and especially my pinky finger. Did anyone else have these problems.",2

"Terrified I have myocarditis and will suddenly die soon I've been suffering cold-like viral symptoms for the last 10 days, and I'm terrified the virus will attack my heart in a condition known as myocarditis. It began as a sore throat and a constant need to clear my throat, but has now progressed to a hacking, productive cough. I have also had some chest pain today, although admittedly it feels muscular.

Roughly 4 days into my symptoms (6 days ago now) I went to ER and they performed ECG and took blood. Cardiac troponins were not elevated and ECG was normal. However, I can't get my mind off the idea that because my viral symptoms have worsened, the virus is attacking my heart and I now have myocarditis.

Is it worth going to ER again for an ECG and cardiac troponins to put my mind at ease? I've been reading reports over at the myocarditis foundation website and what strikes me as particularly terrifying about this disease is its tendency to randomly cause sudden death without prior warning. 

I mean, as a health anxiety sufferer whose condition arises from a fear of death, this is the worst illness I ever could've learned about. ",2

this is my first reddit post also my first time sharing this information with anyone but i can t really keep it in anymore man so bear with me hopefully there s a psychiatrist out there that will read this and hit me with some world altering advice because there is absolutely no way in hell i will ever tell anyone especially not a doctor or psychiatrist what you are about to read but i really just need to get this out there first and foremost no im not going to kill myself let s get that out of the way but i do think im depressed i wa telling myself it wa just a life slump for a long time then i wa telling myself it wa just sadness from the slump now i ve literally been sad and thinking negatively of myself almost every day for like a year and i got ta talk about it with someone even if someone is this phone screen i ve always had major self esteem and confidence issue not really sure what it stem from but i have always felt inferior to those around me which btw i can not believe people live life happy with their appearance that is a blessing that people take for granted anyways ive done some research and educated myself with the science behind depression and i believe that over the past few year a mix of rapid lifestyle change and stress related event ha caused me to have depression the part that confuses me is that while my life is on the more stressful and busy side of thing i don t feel like it s a bad life to live i have wonderful friend family i have a great scholarship to a good school i do fun thing and go to party and drink i feel like an average person put in my shoe would be happy and excel if they had any drive or passion at all which i do not probably why i fuck everything up all the time it is common for me to have suicidal thought i really don t know why since in reality i wouldn t want to kill myself i may be a piece of shit but im not selfish nor do i like the pain of self harm i am self aware of these thought and i have attempted breathing and thought altering method to get rid of them but they pierce my heart and mind like a dagger it physically hurt they are not always about suicide but they are always very negative targeted at myself i just can t help staring out at the edge of that cliff wishing i had the nut to finally end it all sometimes i can t look at myself in the mirror because i know it ll lead me to thinking negatively about myself just at the sight of me and a sad a it is to say it i really just do not like myself i look in the mirror and want to smash it or rip my face off because of how ugly i am objectively and on paper i am not the worst looking guy im and im physically fit but holy shit i swear what i see in the mirror and what other people see when they look at me must be completely different there have been a few instance in recent month of people tell me im decent looking or im good looking or i have a nice body and i take the compliment and try and try to see it in myself but i just can t i literally can t i don t see it i don t know where you guy are looking but i truly don t see what you see okay it s not just about my appearance i find myself annoying and awkward i try to be a happy go lucky guy most of the time usually bringing conversation and a smile and sarcasm and even some humor sometimes but behind my smile is most commonly a frown im fucking annoying my thought scream at me at how what i just said is so stupid and i need to shut the fuck up why do i talk so much why would i ask that ect i talk too much sometimes i say thing i dont even mean or agree with just to say something i never know when to talk and when not to and it frustrates me a lot im volatile and irritable and ugh i fuck up most thing i do work school relationship you know how it go the classic poor me self pity i ruin everything type shpeal something about the way i wa made is just wrong i guess that s another one of those negative thought that repeat in my head a lot born wrong today i had the pleasure of envisioning myself fist fighting myself beating my own face in felt great honestly wish i could ve made it a reality i can t find happiness in any of the thing i used to enjoy ive gradually stopped all my hobby except for the gym which is where i take my anger out usually i have a lot of that i can t even sit through a movie without thinking what is the point of me doing this what is the point life feel numb pointless i go about my societal life just like everybody else i study work play sleep rarely but it all feel the same a gray bland mesh of nothing even something like eating delicious food i just don t get enjoyment anymore the best way i can explain how i feel is if im with people and someone make a joke that people laugh at of course i laugh but if nobody else laughed i would never know when to laugh honest opinion of myself i fucking suck im lazy and i lie all the time to keep up a persona of not being a sad downer hater fuck i constantly make poor decision and can t seem to learn from previous one im ugly the only thing im good at are mansplaining and making a fool of myself i say dumb shit and get shit on for it what kind of asshole ha the privilege and opportunity that i have and is still sad and lazy like this im the type of person that wa actually just wired wrong in the head and the fact that i try and try to be appreciative of my life and still can t disgust me to be honest i don t even know who i am a few month ago someone asked me what my hidden talent is i replied nothing i don t have one i really don t have a talent or something im good at and seeing people around me do amazing thing and then watching myself dig deeper and deeper into this rut really hurt i do not feel like this id say about 0 of the time i forget about all my stress and worry and appearance and fuck ups and im actually happy then when the happy go away i realize that whatever made me happy is so very temporary and it all come flooding back im just running around my mess of a life chasing those euphoric mindless high and happiness that seem to get weaker and shorter each time i find them the question i find myself asking often is why why am i doing this why do i feel this way why did i say that why did i do that why am i a certain way yadda yadda i am a realist i also truly believe there is no point to this life why do we all live such stressful unrewarding life putting all our effort in just to die and be forgotten forever i read comment on post like these saying that life is beautiful meet everyone you can experience nature get help it get better it can get better but the thing is no it can t everyone s situation is different i guess but where im at and what im doing nothing gon na change im not going anywhere even if i wa it wouldn t matter societal standing and fancy job position mean nothing human are not made equal everyone is different special in their own way therefore some people are biologically and factually better than others whether it s stronger larger smarter faster people are different and some trait are preferable i just happened to get stuck with the trait that make me fucking suck at life no amount of meditation or antidepressant fuck big pharm is going to change who i am people don t change painting a leopard red doesn t remove his spot it just hide them temporarily well it s and im going to the gym at and then lecture after that so i guess i should sleep a few hour so my motor function stay working so i can keep going on in this endless cycle of pointless effort thanks for

We have been together since high school and recently thing have been really tough between us. He has suffered with depression for years but has never actively tried to get professional help for it no matter how much I encourage him. Lately we have been bickering and butting heads very frequently so we have decided to take some space apart whilst he works on himself. The partner he is to me at the moment I really do not like. I want someone who will show me love and affection and I feel like he does not have the mental energy to do that for me lately. He does not even seem remotely grateful that I have stuck by him and loved and supported him throughout. I asked him to give me some reassurance like at least be like I love you and I am working on things to be better for you but he said he does not feel that way so he does not want to lie. I do not know if this relationship is just pointless or if I should be patient and support him through this too but I am tired. I feel like he takes advantage of me being there and does not appreciate me but then am I asking for a lot for someone who is suffering from depression?

I feel fear.Will this ever go away? This is my first legitimate date and I would hate to screw this up.

"Trying a new way of thinking. My day normally looks something like this...
Oh man I'm dizzy. I wonder what that means. Any my left arm is weak. Is that a heart attack? Maybe a symptom of a small heart attack? Where did I get that bruse on my knee? Is that a sign of a blood clot? Should I go to the doctor again? Last time he told me to stop worrying about stuff like this. Is that a lump I'm the back of my head? Maybe that's what's causing my head ache... But what is the lump is another sign of a problem? Should I start documenting this? The doctor thinks I'm crazy but if I have all the symptoms with the times I had them he could surly run more tests. A friend I knew died for a blood clot that the doctors missed maybe my doctor missed something... etc

Recently, I started asking my friends that don't have anxiety how they deal with strange feelings in their body. Every single one of them says that they almost immediately dismiss the thought. I can't even imagine what that feels like. I focus on a part of my body so much sometimes that I actually create pain that doesn't exist. So I dug a little bit deeper and asked what happens if they were walking around one day and all of a sudden they noticed that their left arm was weak and tingly. Most of my friends with without anxiety said the same thing. I guess my arm is weak today. And then that's it. If they have a headache or if they have a chest pain or if they have an upset stomach or if their leg hurts out of nowhere they just shrug it off and think oh I guess today I'm going to have a stomach ache or I guess I'm coming down with something or something to that nature. And then if it still hurts the next day they shrug it off again and only when it's continuing to do it for like a week do they actually think I'll maybe I should go to the doctor and have it looked at. But it's not in a panicky kind of way it's just kind of like almost annoyance.

So I'm going to try that method. ""Oh I guess I have a headache today"". And try to leave it at that. If it lasts a week, all the  talk to my doctor.

Has anyone had success doing something like this? Like just changing the way you thought?",2

And because of this I always would get a red face from embarrasment and I guess she took notice because the time we we learning about why the face goes red she decided to ask me a question about it knowing my face would go red and once it did she said ""oh look it's happening now"" which obviously made it 10x worse and she littarly made me stand up and face the class it was one of the worst days of my school life.

My job is causing me an unreal amount of anxiety, to the point where I have to hide in the basement sometimes so I can calm down. I work for a second hand shop for games, DVDs, consoles, and devices like phones and laptops, I started working here about a month ago and from my first day I realised that I was really going to struggle here. 

It's a team of about 25 people and nearly all of them are moody pricks that haven't even introduced themselves to me yet! When I ask them a question they give me a look as if I've just murdered their pets. I try to be nice, and I try to keep a positive outlook, but these people are majorly draining my energy and fuelling my anxiety. The customers are even worse! I've been called homophobic slurs, had games and DVDs tossed at my head and have had my life threatened by these people. 

I haven't been trained properly either. I got thrown on the tills with about two minutes explanation of how they work! My till has been down in cash about four times, due to my crappy training and yet somehow this is my fault - maybe it is, but I'm putting this down to crappy training. 

I can't afford to leave this job, I seriously can't. But I also can't stand being there any more. The job market in Scotland is awful at the moment and virtually no companies hiring right now. 

Please, give me some advice before I start screaming every time I think about my work.",3
"How do you even begin to explain your depression? I am hurting and I feel super alone. I have people around me and I am sure they will listen, but to what extent? I have ended up here because I feel like I am imploding and just want someone to hear me and know what I feel. I am a wife and a mother of one. My marriage is happy and my son is amazing, but I cannot get away from my depression and anxiety. I have had a bounty of traumatic experiences growing up, but who has not? I truly try to live for each day and leave the past where it belongs. I am extremely self-aware. I understand my mental illness. I am a very analytical person. I think that because of this, it makes my mental health worse. I want to fix myself, but I do not know how. I have extreme fears of being alone. I am terrified my husband will eventually decide to leave me because I am such a disaster (though he has shown no intention of this at all). Who wants to be married to a crazy person, right? I have never been in a relationship that was not emotionally abusive until I married my husband. Both of my parents were drug addicts and I was raised by my grandparents (who are incredible by the way). My biological mother (who was physically and emotionally abusive) is still a piece of work (putting it nicely). It took years, but my dad recovered and I do love him very much even though he still has some issues I am still uncomfortable with. In spite of that I have become a successful person. I swore Id never ever let my children see a moment of what I did as a child, and I have not, but I am still here feeling like a failure. I feel worthless. My insecurity is disgusting and my fears are eating me alive. I guess it does not help that I have barely any friends and now that I am working from home I am basically left to my own torment, every day. I used to have loads of friends when I lived in another city, but once I became pregnant I decided I needed to be closer to family. I did not move back home, just near. So I moved to a small town where I know no one. After starting my job once I moved. I have begun to have friends again, but none of them I feel close enough to be able to really open up. Honestly they are probably very open to listening, but I am still here terrified of judgment and causing what little friends I do have to go running for the hills. Because who wants to be friends with someone so mentally unstable?I am tired of crying and I want my brain to stop. I just want to fix my mental state. I can fix everything else. I can give the best advice and I have picked so many people up from very low points in their lives, but I cannot fix me. I am so sorry this is so long. Honestly I could write a novel because there are so many sub-categories to what is adding to my mental health crisis, but where do you even start when you have never been heard?I am so tired. I do not even know anymore",1

"My stress is out of control Quick brief : 25F first born daughter, ideally most responsible in family. Over achiever in school and life as general. Grew up in a high overstimulating environment. Always planning ahead 


Current : I’ve always been great have blocking  out my stress or simply over working through my stress but it seems has if my mind has ran out of storage space and my stress is showing up in physical ( weight loss, withdrawn , isolation , lack of motive , hopeless ness )….. once again the over achiever in me is trying to over ride that with exercising / yoga, prayer, new goals and hobbies….. ( more stress for my schedule because I have to maintain knowing I’m stressed out already ).


Emotional well-being : lost two family members back to back and ended a few friendships so I feel uncertain about life, trying to adapt to change and feeling unsafe and insecure 


Symptoms : 2020 physical panic attacks 
Late 2020 -2021 burst into hives

I’m in therapy slowly helping but I need advice on someone whose actually expended and over came “ calm down “ is not enough. I’d like to get this under control for a bet te r future",3

"Freaking out about chipping a tooth I was eating a hamburger today and I felt a crack in the back of my mouth. I made the burger (from a premade frozen patty), and I didn't season it with anything that could make a cracking noise. Now I'm freaking out, worried that I cracked a tooth. I can't feel anything obvious, but I am noticing an asymmetry in the shape of one of my rearmost teeth when feeling it with my tongue.",2
"I have been in the hospital twice this year and while I may not be suicidal any longer, I still hate life. I do not enjoy the things I once did. Every day is a burden and I cannot wait until I get to sleep at night. Sleep is the only thing I look forward to. I hate being awake",1

"Stomach pain Anybody else get horrible stomach/chest pain for days on end when immense stress is in your life? 

It's finals, and last year I had the same exact issue during finals. Stomach pain. I can only assume that it's bad heartburn ... I feel bloated like a dead animal in the blazing heat. Feels like a big sharp iron bit of metal is in there twisting and pulling at my organs 

It's impossible to move or eat and last time I went to the Dr about it they put me on an anti acid and sent me home 

I hope it's just stress, does anybody else get this???",3
"German Shepards, Labrador Retrievers, Golden Retrievers and Poodles all seem like a good choice. Poodle would be good for allergies as many of my close family have allergies. Shepadoodles, Labradoodles, and Golden Doodles might also make a good choice if they were from bloodlines that had proven to be hypoallergenic. I've trained a therapy dog in the past who was a labradoodle. Lovely dog.",0
"Thinking about skipping graduation? I am a little sad that I have to post on this sub again. i suffered from depression since high school. When I was in college, I saw a therapist, which really helped. I thought my depression was finally gone for good. But 3 years later (graduating from a community college), my therapist (another one) just helped me realize I still have depression. For a long time, I have mistaken it for anxiety, but depression made more sense. I feel so sad right now, I am dealing with a lot. I know the core of my depression and am fighting it. 

Anyways, my graduation is next month in April, and I don't feeling like celebrating. I don't want to go. I think I am worthless and not worth celebrated for. I think I don't deserve love, I don't like it when my family celebrates me, I just don't feel like it, I don't deserve all that love and happiness. I am scared. it overwhelms me.

I am aware that I am talking to myself very negatively. With everything (job, relationships, school,...) that is happening right now, I can't put more eggs in my basket, I really don't wanna deal with my graduation now, I have too much going on already.

I just needed to rant about this.",1
"If its the wrong place for this feel free too delete,  it would be on par with the rest of the day. Edit:  thank you,  too those who've responded and any others who might.

"Low pulse rate - Could 1.5 weeks of exercise result in lowered atenolol dosage? I have been taking 100 mg atenolol daily for quite some time now (several years). I was prescribed it for an elevated testing heart rate of about 90 to 100. No history of heart problem, negative stress test. The atenolol seemed to be doing it's job as my resting heart rate fell to about 70 bpm. Fast forward about 1.5 weeks ago I changed my diet and started walking about 3 miles every day (90 minutes). Today I notice that my resting heart rate is 50 bpm. I would not think the exercise could improve my heart rate that quickly, but could it? Could such little time exercising be lowering my heart rate such that the atenolol can be decreased (tapered down over time)?",2

"I am not sure if I should submit my question to a professional. So that is why I post it here first. I am 35 years old and actually not happy since my puberty. My life does not seem to get off the ground. My younger brother is now married and even has children while I see obstacles everywhere. I have a few friends I can talk to but see less and less. Because they are now also getting married and having kids. I do not feel connected to my environment especially with the people everyone seems to be only concerned with themselves and winning, I am not interested in more and more and mainly looking for a friendship while most people are only interested in transacional friendships. Bought a house (noisy) that I regret and am very sensitive to noise and what people think of me. Most people all seem to function on some kind of autopilot. I do not know what to do with it everyday becomes more and more heavy. Am I suffering from depression? I do not know what to do anymore",1

Now I am 20 floating around minimum wage jobs lost af. I just feel like time is running out and am heading nowhere in life. I do not know what career I want to do and am to scared to take the jump. I feel like there are infinite paths infront of me and each lead somewhere but I am to scared I will pick the wrong one like I did with hospo. I tell myself I am trying to take it slow and figure it out so I do not rush into anything bad, But doing nothing makes me feel so empty and voided.

"I feel like my mental illness has completely overtaken my words, actions, decision making, etc. to the point that I am such an entirely different person.

Its in every part of my life and I am lost. I have no clue who I am anymore. Completely lost",1
Is there something I can do to stop from feeling so utterly alone ( I have friends and family) but I feel so alone. Nothing I seem to do helps me. I work outdoors so I am in the sun. I just do not know how to deal. And things are getting worse I am starting to not want to leave my bed I really do not want to eat tho I know I need to. I game a lot but I feel as if I use it as a distraction to keep my mind from further spiraling down. I just want to know what can I do to help bring this around Just down,1
"Brain can’t function after a depression episode I am just curious that is there anyone just like me. If yes, I really need some advice.

I recently had a very bad depression episode few days ago, and even though I am done with the episode and my emotions are more stable right now, my brain doesn’t seem to be functioning in any way. 

I thinking of everything but nothing at the same time. Like I really can’t catch my thoughts or even think anything logically or sensibly. And I feel like a zombie, just do everything based on experience and instinct.

And the worst part is, people don’t understand that because you look completely normal and functional. They think you’re fine now because you stop crying or being depressed. You can finish normal tasks or conversation because you are in autopilot mode, but when it comes to something that requires more brainpower, you are broken.

And sometimes it takes weeks or months to really snap out it but life doesn’t give you the luxury of doing that. It stresses me out.

How on earth do I suppose to do to deal with this?",1

"Feeling overly depressed because I do not feel as successful as my friends. My bsf is about to graduate PA school and once said to me, if a job does not offer me more than $80k, I am not taking it. As a future educator in the US, all I could do was sit there in silence. I obviously am aware that both of our jobs are very different and essential in their own ways, but it just really rubbed me the wrong way. I have another friend who is very very proud of her accomplishments and is flashy about her income and the things she can afford. I am proud of my friends, but when it comes to being an a**hole about your careers and what you are bringing in, I cannot help but feel like sh*t. I can tell myself that I am going to shape the lives of the future, but that still does not seem good enough. If it does not show on my paycheck, then other people do not view you as successful. I am just really sad about it and never want to be around anyone because that is one of the main topics of discussion. Depressed over not feeling successful",1

To make matters worse, I ate some ice cream and nutella today (when i say some i mean a lot lol rip). I'm also afraid I have heart disease or something because I have a sedentary lifestyle.

"First time poster so excuse my grammar and format...I met my wife about 3 years ago, fast I know but I was so happy. I had been so lost and depressed and I found some one who showed real interest in me...some one who loved me for me. But I had my own issues and problems. I hurt her over and over (not physically and I never cheated) and she gave me chance after chance. We had a beautiful baby girl 13 months ago...finally I had the family I always wanted...A family of my own, a beautiful wife and daughter. But I continued to screw myself and her over with my actions...I was not present mentally...I was not supportive enough. We would get into arguments that made both of us want to kill our selves. we have both tried at different points...we both self harm. But now its all over...our relationship is dead to her. She really tried, I did not try nearly hard enough. I did love her, I really did...but I am just a selfish bastard. We did not end in a horrible way at all, in fact we still live together for the sake of our daughter. But for all the times I have hurt her...for all the chances I had...I guess this karma coming full circle? I just feel so broken, hollow and cold. Like I am not the one who should get any form of pity...I felt so bad that I need to vent in some way...to feel...something. I cut my self bad enough to need a hospital visit...I guess that box cutter was not as dull as I thought. But the funny thing is I did not even feel it...I feel like I am regressing back into the person I used to be...the one who shuts out the world. Cutting made me feel better for a little bit...but its not enough. I do not want to die, more like I cannot die. My daughter did not ask to be here, and I owe it to her to stay around for her. But I want it to end deep down...I keep thinking I should have died in that motorcycle accident years before we met. If I did not have my daughter, I probably would have put a bullet in my head already.For all the mistakes I made...I am so sorry...I wish I could take it all back. I wish I could start over again. I was so happy for the first time in years...and now its all gone. I am such a fool. I think I need to be medicated...but I just cannot afford that kind of thing right now, let alone set professional help.Anyway...I just wanted to rant/vent...thanks Venting-I lost everything I ever wanted due to my own mistakes",1

"I have been hording thoughts like candy lately. No matter who you open up to, it seems like there is not an actual release. It feels like a waste of breath and a burden for those around me. I will get excited about an activity and as I start to put my mind and soul into it, I just fall off. No matter what it is. Photography, gaming, socializing, working on self-improvement and so on. I always repeat a cycle and I have even started working on reframing thoughts. Relearning good concepts (being kind to myself, etc.) It just does not work in the long run. My mind is chronically pessimistic and I hate it. I do not associate with it, but then when my depression or anxiety hit it is all me. I hate ALL of me. I cannot even remember basic concepts, map layouts, lines of code and such. I really cannot do this too much longer. I do not want to die, but I do not want to be a burden or feel pain like this pretty much daily. I talk to friends, but I feel like they are secretly judging me or waiting to remove me from our groups. I talked to family, but I am sure they do not believe me. I talk to doctors and they dismiss or batch it to be one thing and one thing only. Granted ,I could not even be fully blunt about it initially. So this is on me in at least one way. The hospital environment makes it worse. I have been numerous times and I always fake my way out because I do not like it. it is not meant to be liked, but it builds more anxiety. I will eat, sleep, eat, sleep and get meds and such. My history of anxiety is long, but I do not think I am heard as well as others. I do not know what to do or where to go. I cannot even get a hold of my mental health assistive team. Voicemails or no trace of who called. Damn.. I am lost and do not know where to find ""hope"".",1
"Numbness sensation on chest around heart after waking up once in a while - please... does anyone else experience this? So this is seriously at risk of ruining my day after doing so well for so long, so I'll try keep it brief.

I read an article about snoring and sleep apnoea last night - according to everyone who's ever slept in a room with me, I do snore heavily, but don't have sleep apnoea.

But this article I read said that even snoring is bad for you, and I got freaked out. I wake up sometimes with dead or asleep arms, making me think there's something seriously wrong with my heart and circulation, though my fiance convinced me this is just cause I move my arms to weird positions and the circulation gets cut off temporarily.

But something my fiance can't talk me down from is the fact that sometimes I wake up with red indents/marks all over my body, along with like a numbness or asleep feeling around my lower chest on the left side, stretching around to my side. 

The thing is I can only ever remember this happening on the left side - I.e. where the heart is, but I'm always very groggy when this happens so maybe it does happen on the right and I don't take notice? I only bring it up because it happened recently. The sensation goes away within 10 minutes or so.

Has anyone else ever experienced this? It only ever happens when I am in very deep sleep, having very vivid dreams and then wake up suddenly.

"&gt;If its too long do not read .Ok this is so lame and desparate sounding. but I have some questions which I do not want to keep asking or to be thinking and wondering when I start to get better with my ocd. I have two Questions. Anyone who can give a good answer thanks. Not just what I want to hear. But the truth. Because I am not planning on asking these questions ever again. And I want to know the real consequences of this sin. Its really important since it was singled out and I really want sound bible advice on this sin and the punishments if you know it . First on the blasphemy of The Holy Ghost. I did it like 5 months ago out of bitterness for my life. &gt; &gt;And as paul in the bible said that because many were bitter many be came defiled I think that is what he said. So when I realized I was angry at my life and was trying to do better. And I was not done with some habits I tried to promise God TO quit. I still had no real joy in my life and I promised to give up things I loved. Like certain music and foods. Also I was not very nice. Because I loved my family. But they like other things because of their judgements and the things they say to me, I tried to protect myself. So it could have both been bitterness and like ptsd and trying to avoid them and being tough and walking with a hard look and a stump so they would not feel comfortable enough to try to speak to me. &gt; &gt;Just to say some messed up useless stuff. which is harder for me to get over. Mainly because I do not have any real friends or people who just like me. Only my siblings and parents. I have depended on them for a lot and that was where I went wrong. Trying to make them love things about me they just hated, and they basically shuned me. For an example this may be tmi. But just to show some sick stuff my dad has bullied me about. Once I had a pad. For periods. And you know not to flush them. &gt; &gt;So instead of like my mom she wraps it in the paper and puts it in a bag so it will not leak or anything and so you cannot see it in the trash. Now I was feeling bad and did not want to get one. So I got like basically the whole roll of tissue and wraped my pad in it. Now like in the next thirty mintues my dad was wodering where all the tissue went and freaking out. And he decided to look through the trash because he was trying to firgure out why it was all gone. And found a wad of tissue and then when seeing there was a pad init or it was bleeding through and then he like came out and asked if it was me. &gt; &gt;Then I said yeah that is mine. He said it was disgusting and that he did not want to see that. And then he grabbed me by the arm and like brang me in their mom and dads room and yelled at me. And like said it was gross and nasty and I looked at my mom and she was like what ever I am tired of you, and then he ask what was wrong with my hair and I said my hair is fine. Then he got a mirror and was mockingly like does this look done and laughing. Then he said Id be shocked if I saw you in heaven. Over a pad with blood that he went looking for in the trash. &gt; &gt;Think he went and dug through the trash looking for shit. that is like me going and putting my hand in the toliet and finding shit and being shocked what did you expect you was going to find doing that. So that is just a taste of what he does. Trust me I do not always complain about every minor inconvenience. Then I do not want to be ew because God is God and can say what he wants. But I have an older sister she is 24 and is kidna fast and she was a teen mom. And I kind of judged her tho I was only jealous of her because dad loved her so much. Like anytime my sister would come around Id love seeing her and my niece. &gt; &gt;More then all my siblings and mom. she is my half sister by the way/ only one who loved seeing her more was my dad. So that being said I still was jealous of her and it totally was not her fault. Now all this shit was in my head and I was bitter. and I kind of would take it out on my siblings not out loud but in my head. and I was angry at GOD AND MY FAMILY FOR WEEKS BLASPHEMYING AND STUFF BEING RUDE. And I decide to read the bible and then he had like passages for me cuz I blaspheymed and was trying so hard to be good. And then the bible had a passage about the virgins in israel doing a very horrible thing and saying as if it were a little thing they were more defiled then everyone idk. &gt; &gt;But also it had one about ahloa and her sister and I knew that was for me tho I am not a whore. It was like this is the sins of your sister. And my golly that were totally describing my sister being a little fast eatting a lot and being pridful and kind of selfish. But then he said init she is better then you. Like it said your sister is like in all she has done better then you, and for that momment it was like a badly written sitcom. You know like where the sad and depressed one keeps trying to show their good and better. &gt; &gt;And the other is care free and happy and does not care as much but some how ends up better then you and that is how this is God tried to paint me out to be this evil and envious person which sometimes I am. So that brings me to these questins like in my other post I do not like suprises I like to know things so I do not have to worry about them. I sont mind being told no I am not peter. But thinking your going to do or get something and then not is like not very good, and I know you guys are so much more wiser then me and read the Bible more and listen so this is the question , this maraggie supper of the lamb is said only blessed are those which are called. &gt; &gt;And I hate being left out of stuff. Tho my dad says some in heaven will not go, now like saul when he was rejected from being king because of his disobediecne. I just wanted to know since I called the holy ghost evil and also I um publicly tried to slander him in a sneaky way online if you look at my other post you will see.. Dose that hurt my chances like is there any bible verse to back this thought of mine up just asking. And that last one is as you all know this see I read something about like in the greek bible translation it was a novum testamentum graece and it said I do always let go the sons of men the sins and the blasphemy as much as it is blasphemyed but he who blasphemys against the Holy Ghost has not let go but is guilty of an eternal sin. &gt; &gt;So I also do not really want eteranal guilt so those are the only two questions thanks.

"Hi all,The last few years have been awful to me. Although I am 19 and at a very good university, life is so tough right now. I was diagnosed with depression 5 years ago, not because of any external factors, but just because me lmao. My family has always been fine, and we are close and supportive, and my friend groups over the years know what is happened.The past 4 summers, however, have been awful and I am losing everyone I love.3 years ago, I had a complete mental breakdown over my thoughts spiralling, and nearly committed suicide. I did not tell any friends about this, and was too mentally exhausted to socialise over most of the summer, and I lost many friends by just not seeing them.2 years ago, I broke up with my girlfriend. It was sad as any breakup is, but was made worse by false rumours she had made about me. We broke up just entering into summer break, and that summer was really tough. I worked on myself over summer, but I became very anxious about what everyone thought about me, and I lost a lot of my humour.Last year, of course covid hit, so we were in lockdown, which was isolating. Just to add fire to my already depreciating mental state, my dad was diagnosed with laryngeal cancer in April. Thankfully that is one of the safer cancers to have, but I would not ever wish the experience on anyone. Over this summer, he had rounds of radiotherapy and scans and it was so stressful. I joined uni later this year and, although I made a fair few friends, my dad was always on my mind and I could not enjoy myself as much.This summer, I have been framed for a completely horrid allegation, and the investigation process is so painful and mentally exhausting. I am trying my hardest to stay positive but it has taken away my social battery completely, and once again, summer has not been kind to me. To add to this, my dad had gotten a recurrence on his cancer, and his voice box had to be taken out, and he was in hospital for 2 months recoveringHas anyone else had years of just horrible stuff happen, and what advice can you give to try and get through all of this. Also, what professional help do you think would be appropriate (I have tried antidepressants but i did not like them) Sorry for the long read, but thanks How do you look past all of the bad things life gives you",1

crazy feeling anxiety attack i’ve had a couple anxiety attacks recently that really freaked me out they start in the middle of the night and most the time from me becoming super aware of my teeth then i spiral and have incoherent thoughts or like the same sentence just playing over and over in my head words stop making sense and my body feels like a machine i become hyper aware of my breathing and it doesn’t feel right when it first happened i swear a past out and got transported to a astral plane or something like some tool album cover shit recently have been feeling like nothing is really real and just a result of chemical reactions in my brain yfm has anyone else felt this way too,2
"The other day. ""Depressive"" emotions overwhelmed me. Shrugged them off like other thoughts and moved on. Later. I realized, I cannot.Processing thoughts in itself become hard. Much less, insignificant habits of not wanting to do anything. I wished it remained there.... it did not.I had begun traversing to unknown territory, desiring the comfort of non-existence. Cherished this thought like it is home for me. Normalizing ""Wanting life"" is like crying from a happy dream. it is never reality.do not get me wrong, suicide is not in my options. Me dreading existence is not me loving human death. Experiences in life are precious. Feelling emotions which a rock cannot feel is a merit(kind of). I love happiness but feel burdened by my past, my experiences and my existence. To embracing the hypothetical world of no me. Daydreaming the no-ever-was-here. IDK. Therapist is not an option either. I am 19 dependent on my parents who I tried to get me checked up for ADHD, but received my very-happy news of me possessed and should real the holy book etc. -_- Am I really depressed?",1
"I know...the title sounds annoying and desperate...but I really needed to tell someone, anyone. This is probably a result of PMS...but I really do want someone to lay in bed and cry to. I am so touch starved and lonely. I have felt this way for years. I just want someone to hold me and reassure me. To comfort me through all the shit I go through. Sometimes the loneliness gets so bad and I cry alone in my bed. Sometimes I wrap myself around a pillow and have to pretend it is someone, a boyfriend, for comfort. This is one of those times. Ik after this I will get up, brush myself off, and get on with my life, like I always do. I have to. But it would just be so nice to have someone hold me and whisper sweet nothings to me. To feel his warm embrace and his fingers play with my hair. To make me feel like I am worth protecting. Like I am important to at least someone. I am always fighting with myself internally. Ik that I should not have to depend on anyone for happiness. That I should be my own independent woman or whatever. And it is not like I am going to settle for someone who does not treat me right....and I know life is not all about love and relationships....but I just...I love feeling WANTED by somebody. Maybe that makes me needy and codependent but I just love it so much. I love being praised and spoiled with love. It hurts when I see other people living the life I want to live. Like I am happy for them...but it hurts bc I want that so badly. I want to be somebody is baby too. somebody is world. I want to be special to somebody too. Honestly it does not help that I might have daddy issues....Anyways I needed to get that off of my chest. Thanks for reading it all if you have gotten this far. &lt;:) I want a boyfriend so badly right now",1

After like 10min however, my eyes started to feel weird like my perception has changed, I'm still able to type and stuff and I'm not dizzy nor do I have a headache. I even went ahead and played a game to see if I could focus and I was fine. I took a nap to see if it would help, I woke up an hour earlier and it still feels weird. I was just wondering, is this something I shouldn't be so anxious about or should I go to the doctor? It might just be my anxiety playing tricks on me which has happened before but I'm not sure.",2

"What is wrong with me? I’ve always been extremely articulate and smart. I operated on a higher consciousness than most people just in the sense that I was more aware of my surroundings and I thought deeply about things. I was also quick witted and being funny was probably my defining personality trait. Until about a week ago, I felt like my normal self (still a very anxious person regarding my health, particularly a brain tumor). Now I just feel like there’s been a substantial cognitive decline. I can’t think as deeply and I’m constantly second guessing myself on if I’m using words correctly. I feel Ike my vocabulary is getting worse and I google synonyms for words about 30 times a day. At the same time, I also feel more relaxed. It sounds weird but I’d rather feel smart and anxious than dumb and relaxed. I’m not even particularly happy. I feel like I have no emotions (something that has been persisting for a while) but now I feel like I have no intelligence (something new to me). I am slower to respond in arguments and don’t feel as witty as I was two weeks ago. Maybe I’m thinking too much about my speech but I just wish I could revert back to normal. Everything just feels so superficial to me. It’s weird. I know a symptom of brain tumors is a shift in consciousness. I’m messing up when I talk a lot more. I feel like I’m forgetting words and not winning in arguments (very rare for me). I’m only 15 (almost 16) and feel like I have Alzheimer’s or something. On a side site, the only other truly concerning symptom I have that could be indicative of something more serious is the smell of smoke occasionally. This isn’t a daily occurrence or even a weekly but maybe once or twice a month, I’ll get a whiff of the faint smell of smoke that is certainly not coming from real life. As of lately, I just feel so dumb. I just can’t stress the fact that I’ve never felt this way before. I hate this feeling. I haven’t really had emotions for a while (this is due to some trauma I’ve been through) but lack of intelligence is brand new. I may not be completely devoid of my intellect (as I’m able to express my thoughts coherently in this format) but I feel slower than usual. I use to partake in writing creative stories and stuff and I tried to do that yesterday and I struggled and was uncharacteristically out of ideas. Sorry if this sounds repetitive but this has been going on for about a week now and I’m not sure what’s up. My parents won’t let me get an CAT Scan (I got an MRI in March 2016 and everything was fine). Is there a possibly a tumor could’ve developed in this short of amount of time? Thoughts and opinions please. I just feel like a completely different person



Also sometimes when I’d feel really weird or things would get too heavy, I’d cry and the feelings would subside. Now I can’t even cry cause I feel like I don’t even have feelings in the first place. I use to be able to explain this perfectly all the time (or so it felt like) and I took great pride in my ability to articulate things. Now I feel like whenever I do so, there’s a little voice in my head questioning what I say and if it makes complete sense. I now I sound articulate in my post but I don’t feel like I sound like this in real life. Or it at least takes too long for me to express myself. ",2

"I know people post a lot here about Wellbutrin but through googling I have read many of the posts and nothing really rings true for my situation. I am on this like mental health journey trying to find what works for me and I do not really have anyone to talk to about it. I do not even have a family doctor lol. So here I am. I was on 150 XL for a month and I noticed a huge change at the start, my main issue was focus and chronic fatigue, but i found myself falling back to where I was at the end of the first month. Skip to the second month and my doctor kicks it into high gear and gives me 300 XL. The first few days I did not feel much of a change but after about a week or two holy fuck.I feel like I just slid into the side effects salon. For starters, totally forget to eat. I already hate cooking and some days its not until 1:30 in the morning where I am like, fuck, got to sleep but did not eat. When I do eat its only a meal a day. I started a fitness plan and a nutrition plan with a trainer and the food is so fuckin bland I am just not interested (I was 180 pounds before I started now I am 172). I am thinking of going back to some shittier foods so I regain some interest. My sex drive and everything related to sex has been cranked up to a million. Its probably the one thing I am struggling with the most. I am literally always horny (and it shows lol which can be embarrassing). My brain is telling me to go pick up multiple guys off the street and bring them to bed and the last sliver of logic I have is the only thing stopping me.I am never sleepy. I can sleep but I am never actually like, god I need to goto bed, therefore I forget the time and stay up late often.

"Her mother, who has been a full-time elementary school teacher for 28 years, is her primary caregiver, but when the mother is working as a teacher, this amazing lady needs a Licensed Vocational Nurse (LVN) to assist her with her ADLs and health needs so the mother can provide the family income. Her LVN attends to her physical and health needs everywhere that she goes during the day at home, in her college classes, out in the community, and her volunteering sites. She had good luck with LVNs, but her last LVN unfortunately no longer has worked with her since December. Since November, her family has posted the job opening six times online, asked all the local Vocational Nursing schools to post the job, and countless people posted the job opening on social media. No one applied for the enjoyable position, except for one, but she lasted for four hours and she decided that she didn't want the job after all.",0

"I'm an adult who can not sleep alone. So I'm 32f and since I was a kid I've struggled with anxiety and sleeping. Afraid of the dark, night terrors, sleep paralysis all that fun stuff.

My partner, is going away for 2 nights for a work thing. This means I'll be alone in the house. I have never been alone in a house, I've always had house mates or family in the house with me. Any time I was left with a house to myself I would get mates to come over and stay or I would go out. Its only at night when I have to go to bed in the house that I have the issue, I otherwise tend to enjoy being by myself. 

This whole thing is filling me with more and more anxiety. I know i'm building it up alot but its been one childhood fear never managed to sort out. 

I want to get over this, I feel quite pathetic that its causing me so much panic.

Tools at my disposal:
1 incredibly needy cat that sleeps with me every night.
A tv in my room.

"I’m so tired of it all, but I can’t stop thinking something is wrong with me. I’ve never had health anxiety, but I’ve been blessed with plenty of other types. Lately HA seems to be my primary form.

Back in August I visited the ER for 104 degree fever that affected my vision, in October urgent care sent me to the ER for an uncharacteristic migraine. In November I started getting chest pain, which sent me to the ER several times out of fear. After numerous EKGs, blood tests, a stress test, and event monitor setup I’m told I’m fine, but have some PVCs. 

I’m still getting the chest pains, palpitations, and headaches, and multiple doctors ranging from primary care, to ER, to neurologists, to cardiologists all attribute it to stress. 

Last year my blood pressure used to be 121/73 when visiting the doctor, but lately it’s skyrocketed to 150/88 in the office. Taking it at home I average about 128/76, but I can see my pulse go up when I take it.

I’m so scared about a multitude of things happening to me and I can’t stop thinking about the unknown. I don’t know if I’m really okay or if there’s something wrong with me with the constant headaches and other symptoms.

How do people deal with this?",2

"I might not belong in this chat but I just wanted to get this off my chest . Delete if necessary. But I been dealing with some anxiety for as long as I could remember but whenever I get into a relationship with anyone it seems to heighten my anxiety. I am currently in a relationship with this incredible person (or that is what he portrays to me at least). He cooks for me, cleans, really does everything that a boyfriend should do. But I am always getting these voices in my head telling me hes cheating, hes not actually into me, hes waiting for someone better, just playing with my emotions, hes things from me and plenty more scenarios that play over in my head. All these things might not be true but its hard to get past the voices in my head but its hard for me to just tell myself that its me overthinking everything and just worrying over nothing. Hes always reinsuring me that he wants to be with me and he would not be with me if he did not want to be here . But I been with horrible guys in the past that did horrible things to me and want to blame them for why I am like this, but it gets to a point to where I have to look at myself and say its me and my mental health. Here an example of the most recent thing:I was getting out the shower and came out of the room and I noticed he was sad and I proceeded to ask him what is wrong and hes tells me hes having some family drama but hes okay, so I proceeded to give him a hug but I am the back of my head I am thinking maybe someone he was talking to broke up with him and hes sad, hes not happy being with me, or he wants to end things but scared to because he will hurt my feelings. He barely tells me anything about he so I assume hes hiding things from me. I am always the one telling him things about me. Its like hes closed off. But he says hes wants to be with me and have kids.Also he has this thing where he said he would never post me on his social media because hes a private person, so my friends and family are the only people that knows about us and I just feel like someone hes hiding me, so i feel like he does not like me. He tells me that my friends and family should be enough and I should not worry about anyone else knowing. It could be because hes not out yet but I would love to be for people to know about me on his social media. But to sum everything up I looking for advice on how to stop the voices and just be happy with the guy I am with. We only been together for a little over a month, yes I know that is very short but I am known to catch feelings very fast.Thanks for listening to my horrible life Am I overthinking?",1

I am having a hard time showering, cleaning, cooking, basically all self care. I also have adhd so my executive dysfunction makes it hard to start tasks even with medication. Does anyone have any go-to meals, something that I could assemble in the fewest possible steps that would provide adequate nutrition?

The past 3 or so years I've been unemployed. You may think I'm so lazy which is fair. But I've been on medication that made me so numb it was impossible to care about anything. I couldn't sleep properly and had severe insomnia. How could I work like that

Now I'm off of medication and my anxiety is 90000% worse. I somehow sleep longer. But get the worst intrusive thoughts to touch outlets to see if it will kill me or not.

"I am well aware that I fucked up my own life, albeit I did not realise that is what I was doing at the time. Not until it was too late.Fuck up one: Mental health. Just... fuck, man, I do not even know how to fix this one. I am just a damn mess. Everything overwhelms me, everything scares me, and I basically let fear win. I was bullied a lot in school, and had few friends, but I barely passed my GCSEs anyways, I got mostly Cs. But then my friends all moved on and moved away, and I failed A-Levels because of anxiety. I was too stupid to understand what I was doing, too afraid to ask my teachers what to do, and too afraid to even make friends that could help me out. It got to the point where I was taking more and more sick days until I just stopped turning up, because the fear and the hopelessness won out. I gave up. And then I never did anything else. The longer I sat at home being afraid, the worse it got, and not I do not even know **how** to be a regular person. How to look, act, talk... I just panic. I give up before I try.Fuck up two: I believed love was going to save me. I had a boyfriend, from the age of 13 to 24, and I had convinced myself, and he had convinced me, that he was going to make it okay. He was normal, so he got a job, and started helping me with small goals, but he also enabled me and I let him. He promised wed get a place together and someday get married, and I could either look after the home, or find a job when I was ready. Its pathetic, but it was easy and not scary, so I believed it. I let him spoil me, got used to him spoiling me, and believed one day it would just work out. That wed move in together and Id gradually stop being scared, that doctors would one day fix me, but I had time because my boyfriend/eventual husband would help. But then at 24 he left me, and I realised Id put every single egg in one basket. I had no savings, no social life, and no happiness. He was my everything. And I broke **hard** when he left.Fuck up three: I gave up, and I let my family enable and coddle me, as I did with my ex. This is fucking shameful to admit... But I am 27 now and I live with my mum. I have never moved out, because I planned to live with my ex, and he always promised we would one day. (He moved out of his parents house a year after we split.) I have never gone to college or university, because I do not know what I have the skills to do. I have never had a job, because although it was because of my own failings, my mental health is so shit now that I go to interviews and burst into tears out of fear. My brain just shuts off. I do not know how to care for myself, because my mum does everything herself, both because its easier than teaching me and does not want another person getting in the way, and because she loves me and wants to make it easier for me. I know she has my best interest in heart, but it just makes me hate myself more because I am useless. I am a scared child in an adults body and I hate myself for it.I know I have to change. I know I want to change. But finding a start point is hard. Fighting the bad days is hard. Fighting the urge to give up on everything, even life, is hard. The shame makes it harder, but I know I need, deserve, the shame, in order to force me to change. I keep hoping getting on the right meds will help... But fighting the doctors to change or even up my meds is like wrestling a bear, and they never actually do anything. The anxiety, the overthinking, the hopelessness, its all still there. I worry that my brain is permenantly broken.Maybe all I can do is change my life. But change costs money, and willpower, and I do not have much of either.All I know is, I am exactly the worst kind of person. The kind of person that is a waste of resources and money and time. I am sorry. I want to be better. I will try to be better. But I wish there was a guidebook for this.Thank you for listening. I fucked up my life, and now I feel stuck.",1

"One of the big pieces of advice I see for depressed people online is to ""find a hobby"" or find something fulfilling. I can see how this would be a great piece of advice, if it actually worked for me. Any time I pick something new up, I kind of enjoy it, keep doing it for a few weeks (maybe even a month if I am lucky), get bored and then stop. Rinse and repeat, every goddamn time. I have tried the gym, running, tennis, football, joining a hell even playing video games I get bored of eventually. Maybe it is because of my depression, but I really struggle to find something I actually enjoy to the point of wanting to do it as much as possible over a long period of time. Most things that I find which I genuinely enjoy, my enjoyment/determination fizzles out after a few weeks to the point where my effort put in outweighs my enjoyment so I just stop. How do people find things they enjoy and actually want to stick with it for a long period of time??Anyone have any advice? How the fuck do people find things they actually like and stick with it??",1

"I can never relax my neck/shoulders/jaw...any tips? First off, I have PTSD from being in the military. I overreact to stressors in my environment significantly. So I am totally aware of having higher stress levels than the average person. But what I do not understand is why my muscles stay tense 24/7.

I mainly feel this in my neck/jaw/shoulders area. I literally (and not saying this like ""omg I literally died the other day when...but as in the way the term is actually meant for) feel like I cannot let my head relax into my pillow at night. It's like my body refuses to allow the pillow to take the weight of my head. I can consciously think, ""ok, I'm gonna relax my neck now and let my head fall deep into this pillow,"" and it works...for a few fleeting moments until I stop actively thinking about it. Seconds later I will realize that my shoulders are up to my ears again, and my neck is no longer relaxing. 

I keep my jaw tense all the time as well. So much so that I have so many chipped teeth that my dentist has stopped fixing them until they get really bad. I have a bite guard for sleeping, but I think the damage is also done during the day. I asked my wife the other day which was ""normal"" for her: when not thinking about it, do your top and bottom teeth stay closed/touching each other, or is there a small gap? She went with the small gap, and I can see that my body wants that to be my normal too, but it is not. My teeth stay chomped down onto each other, nearly 24/7. I'd bet my neck and teeth stay tense even when I am asleep. 

I absolutely hate this. I can never get comfortable. I cannot sleep well. I look like a 10 year old with ADHD because I'm constantly wiggling around while seated in order to get some sort of comfort here and there. And all this misery boils down to the tension in these 3 areas. 

Anyone have any suggestions for this? I've told my Dr many times at the VA about this, and I have muscle relaxers, but rarely take them because they make me super sleepy during the day, and if I take them at night, I feel kinda hung over the next morning. So I only take them when in absolute discomfort. 

I go to a chiropractor 2x a week. I go to physical therapy for shoulder issues 2x a week. I regularly use a foam roller and a Chirp wheel, almost daily, several times a day. I even started yoga this week...but I've only been once so far. 

Oh, and I get a massage 2x a month, by a massage therapist at the chiropractor, who can target areas of concern from my chiropractic file. So not a feel good massage, but one that works on working knots out and loosening ligaments (not sure if I am using the right terminology there). Last week, after several months, she was able to finally ""get in"" my upper traps and for a few amazing, godly seconds, I actually felt true neck relaxation. It was so wonderful....and so sad when it quickly went back to my normal. But that fleeting glimpse of bliss told me that it is possible to find relief. 

So I have finally turned to Reddit to ask for help.",3

"Yea, well. Here it is. I look at my life up until this point and really dwell on how many things I have been keeping to myself in mystical awe as to how I even manage to do it without driving myself crazy.I feel weird laying in bed tonight. it is 3 AM and I have work at 7 AM. Promised my girlfriend I would work out with her at 4 PM. I hope that still works out considering it is a promise, and I have not worked out in years and am just now mustering up the courage. I want to preface that this post at times may feel it is losing its direction. Sorry about that, I am writing what comes to my head. As I was saying, I feel weird laying here tonight. My mind has a lot of thoughts going through it. Mainly the sense of confusion as to what is wrong with me. Right now I feel like there is a long line in front of me (figuratively). Each thing in line is a different emotion. I am the receptionist at the front of the line, and on most days I would deal with each emotion one at a time. These emotions do not ever seem to have a regular pattern. They can be constantly changing from feelings of sadness to intense anger (internalized), happiness (not too frequent with this one), anxiousness, melancholy, and (what I see the most) a dissatisfying meh that says everything feels fine today, I am still moving along to the extent I can and not thinking about my true inner troubles.BUT tonight, I am not dealing with the line. I am just letting it build up and having the front customer ring the bell over and over for my attention. I am looking at this line with a feeling of confusion and unfamiliarity as if I never dealt with it before. I have all of the emotions stacked up and I cannot seem to be able to process them. I feel everything but nothing at the same time, it is white overwhelming but not at the same time. It sucks it took that long to explain how I feel currently, and the silly part is that I do not feel satisfied from that explanation alone. I notice that for a while I have been unable to trust MY ability, the inky real primary source of myself, to tell someone how I am feeling. Because I am never sure myself. I am never familiar with how I am day today or will be tomorrow. Maybe I am just overthinking all of this or maybe I am not. How am I able to tell someone how I am feeling if I cannot understand or validate my initial thoughts. I know I will probably wake up tomorrow and look at this and brush it off as a bunch of rubbisH, then push it to the back of my head for it all to come back again. FYI I am writing this completely sober. Where will I find my zen? I know that sounds cheesy, but for real, when and how will I find my inner self-understanding. I look at like with different mindsets, and they switch up every day or week without my notice. I just recently got a screen for depression, and for one I did not answer some of the questions honestly because I was too nervous too. But also these questions were driving me crazy, I could not tell how to answer any of them. If I answered them a second time the day after, I would have given different answers. That day I walked out of the doctor's office feeling self-critical and angry about this. I wonder if my mindsets change too much. Maybe my personality is too malleable? I understand that people change, but my view of how I view myself and the environment around me changes a bit drastically sometimes.I obsess over dumb shit. Waist too much time revisiting and spending extended periods of time pondering on them. Lately, I have been very concerned by the possible idea that I may be bipolar or something. I feel so stupid for even typing that out, but that is the truth as to how I have been thinking. I probably am not, and I just overthink everything. But it roots from my desperate want to understand my emotions. Recently, I had a day (i do not remember why) where I felt very very very low and sad. I have not had this feeling in a long time. I physically felt slow. I mentally felt unable to comprehend the external environment. I felt too lost in my head. The world around me shut off, but I was still going on autopilot. I was so sad, I felt numb. This was a build-up to this low from the past couple of days before. I was having some really dark thoughts I do not want to talk about. But the next day I felt so up, to the point I had a euphoric feeling in my body for part of it. Now I feel like I am starting to level out again. That day admittedly, I had a really fun day doing activities, so maybe it was that. But what throws me off is how I went from SO SO LOw (like you have to take my work for it) to SO SO. high.I could go on more and more, but my fingers would fall off from the typing, and I am starting to get tired. I hope this post stays up. I guess all I am asking for is someone to listen. Even if you do not respond to this, thank you for taking the time to hear my rambling. I am sorry if this feels like a shit post, I do not expect everyone reading this to understand or relate, I just do not know how else to convey my accumulating thoughts. I want to just unplug the drain a bit somewhere and for now, this feels like it helps a bit. Venting is great. A drain that I never feel I have the time to unplug.",1

"Slipping Away I feel like I’m slipping away. I navigate bad traffic on the way into work where I’m in a hybrid tech support/business analyst role: so primarily I’m listening to and troubleshooting everyone’s troubles through the day.

The calls sometimes start at 7:00AM and don’t end until after 6:00 other days.  And heavy traffic back home.

Every week this year it seems something around the house is breaking and either needing me to repair it or pay someone to come out.

After sorting out the to-do list time is passed with my dogs, who I love very much but are extremely pushy and needy some days.

That goes on until my father-in-law gets home and demands that the dogs get put away, and everything turned off and focus turned to him so he can tell all about whatever’s on his mind — he lives with us. And if I don’t drop everything I have to hear from his family and somehow my family about how I need to stop hurting his feelings.

Then bed and wake up to start over again.

I get about an hour a week to just myself.  And hour a week to be me.  I feel like I’m losing who I am.",2

"//trigger warning - abuse a lot of stuff happened to me in the last months, actually years, but for some reasons I cannot talk about it with my friends and family, but also I cannot hold it inside of me anymore... I will try to make it short.when I was a really dumb preteen I met a very twisted, depressed sick man who groomed young girls like me at the time (I do not want to go deep into this but I did some really bad things for him, things that a kid should not be doing), he always said that we were what kept him sane and alive, and we believed ofc, and he was not alone, he had this group of other very sick adult man that were not really like him, they did not do the things that he did, they were just some poor depressed man, but being in that social circle has really mess up my head and the way I interact with people.after some years I stopped to meet them but the damaged was already done, I became really scared of things and socially awkward, slowly lost contact with my real good friends, now days I do not even talk with them, and also I stared to really really despise myself, thanks to that I gave up my dream of illustrate books for children because I thought I was not worth it, and things were like that since I finished high schoolnow I need to decide my future, I have no expectations, I cannot escape this cynical way of thinking about the future, and to not help me at all I received the news that that man has committed suicide on may of this year, since then my mind has been at the limit, I think I am getting crazy actually... it is like his ghost keeps following me every where, I cannot focus on anything at all, I do not know what to do anymore!! I cannot talk with my family about this I feel like I am already a big disappointment for them, I do not want to ruin thing even more, and my friends... I do not even talk to them, I do not want to just give them all of my problems like they already do not have their own, the only person I could talk about this was with another girl that I knew at that time, but she is as bad as me, is like two mad people talking to each other, so if you read this... thank you so much, you do not even need to answer anything I just wanted to vent to the nothing but with the possibility that someone might hear me.

"Scared I have MS Hey, I have been having really bad health anxiety for the past week in a half. Pain started in my right index finger. I thought it was because I write and type a lot so I started to rest it. Over the past week, my finger has gotten better but other parts of my body have really been hurting. One day, my shoulders were killing. One night I woke up and my back was killing. The next day, my legs were in so much pain. Now I am just feeling a bit of pain in my back. I am not really active and nothing traumatic happened to me either. I think I just have anxiety in general but these pains are really freaking me out.

I also got blood work done today so I'm waiting for the results. I shouldn't have, but I have been searching up my symptoms online and it kind of sounds like MS, with pain moving around my body.

"is it normal for an SSRI to make you feel like you're literally dying I was prescribed 50 mg Zoloft for anxiety and depression which I took for the first time last night.

I’ve talked to therapist before but whenever the topic of the abuse arises I tense up and can’t remember anything. I’m sorry if I’m rambling on it’s just a hard subject for me to talk about and I don’t know how to put into words the emotions I feel towards these events.,3

"I know it is not possible, but I literally sleep for 4-5 hrs at night, its almost 2:30 am here and as soon as I try to sleep all the thoughts and memories run through my mind, my mind is fill up with all those happy memories of my frnds and gf. Now when I am left alone as I lost all my frnds and gf , I realize how much I cared for them, How much I trusted them, I gave them all I had, Spend enough time with them, Made them laugh, helped them, all I did was loving them truly from bottom of my heart, did all the good things and in return I only got misery, suffering, pain in my chest, insomnia and loneliness. No matter how many sheeps I count at night, my mind ends up in the ocean of my old memories where I was truly happy. And as soon as I realize that tears start rolling through my mind. I just want my frnds and my gf back nothing else. I want someone is shoulder to cry on. I think at some point I will lost my ability to sleep.",1
"While most of the world is moving on from COVID, half of my country is in lockdown. Once I found out that my state was going into lockdown, I cheered. My job causes my depression which in turn makes me almost unable to lead a happy, productive life:* I have not slept well for 3 years (since I started this job)* Would suffer from on-and-off insomnia* No energy to enjoy my hobbies* I would spend most of my post-work time in bed watching YouTube and napping* It took me 2 years to actually start working out (had a gym membership for almost 3 years before I went consistently)* The reason I have not even started university yet is purely because I am burnt out after work and can rarely muster up the energy to play a video game, let alone study (so basically I have not studied properly at all to get into university for 3 years)* I felt angry, depressed, anxious and almost inhuman everydayEver since lockdown started, I have woken up with a smile on my face, my depression is entirely gone, I finally have motivation to do productive things and most of all, I feel human again. I feel like I am almost being gaslighted when I see how many people view lockdown as a terrible thing.I am honestly hoping our lockdown gets extended because I simply do not want to go back to work; the reason I am depressed in the first place. Lockdown has made me the happiest I have been in as long as I can remember",1

"Everything I do is an attempt to fail.

"Stressing about Studying I am in my mid 30s and have just been given the chance to do an extra year and a half of study in a different University. The degree that I have was more theory based and I really need hands on experience to be employable in my field, which I now have the opportunity to do alongside guaranteed internships and portfolio work. 

My stress levels are currently through the roof about this, as I am worried that I won't be able to match the calibre of current high school leavers, who, even though treated as adults at University, still seem to have that high school mentality. My main issue is, even though not permanent, the dorm style accommodation and the fact that an ""old"" person is living with basically a teenager, although I did apply for a single room with a shared bathroom, so maybe not so bad. 

Usually I wouldn't have a problem with this, but already having experienced this with not much success, I am now stressing immensely. I'm not there to be anybody's friend, but the way I have been treated in the past, just for being a little older has been disgusting. There is not much available accommodation at all in the country, so looking for anything else is currently out.

Honestly, I think I'm just stressing because I'm over 30 and feel like I still don't have my life in order, with another future gap in my resume. 

Please tell me I'm going to be ok.....",3
"Mine is not a sad, tragic one. My mom is an okay woman, with good intentions, and like the old saying goes : good intentions pave the road to hell. She got out of poverty and found a good job, was not so successful with my father(lost to another woman), but in South Africa being fatherless is pretty much a character trait everybody has. I have a sister with ADHD, so to prevent my sister from acting up she is strict on us. But she also has a strict background, so it is in the genes.I am 16, male and depressed, not as bad as I used to be 2 year ago, but I am no optimist who tells everyone it gets better, because really it do not. My depression does not root itself in traumatic events and the lack of friends, I have loving friends and though i have been through some sexual shit at a young age, I do not take it too seriously. I got depressed because I questioned previous my religion(Christianity), I am not atheist, i believe there is a God(s), but he is not the over glorified bloke in the Bible, too many ""facts"" about the world points out that he wanted the world fucked up and humans or demons are not the bad guys here. Anyway, I got pressed, life became meaning less and all my dreams of ministering to the world just went to shit. I saw no more reason to live. And it was a downward spiral from there on out. I went back to watching porn and being addicted to it, using the little data got every month, hoping my mom could get that uncapped shit so I fap to all the pawgs out there, I isolated myself a lot and contemplated self harm but my fear of sharp objects refused I tread down that path and refusing to hear any of that positivity bs. You know, the usual's.Then I smoke weed and discovered my interest in art. I fell in love with how artists could portray concepts into simple but deep drawings and paintings. I personally liked non paint art, it just gets me. Art led me to philosophy which then led be to listening to that positive bs which led me to listening to people and appreciating their existence without forcing my ideals and experience onto them, this led me to storytelling and there I fell in love with writing, drawing and mildly socialising. Before I stopped masturbating, and I was actually happy. Still I pushed philosophical thoughts and realised that nothing is as big as I had made it out to be and the little dark box i put myself in was non existent.Then my mothers good intentions kicked in. My grades started fluctuating to to my attention being drawn away from school. When my attention was drawn back to school, I saw it for the farce it was. It barely taught us anything, I brought in so much invisible pressure to kids and was just abuse to the teachers who have to baby sit 40+ children in a class. School sucked, not to mention that textbooks keep repeating the shit they said the previous years and could easily be replaced by youtube and google. When I realised this, I told my mom about it, hoping she would hear me out on my art thing, but she called me names and said I was spewing nonsense. She meant well honestly, she did not want me being poor or homeless, but i do not see myself being rich either. All I want is to draw and tell stories, i do not really care about anything else. Then back came my depression, I was drawing less, still making up stories in my head but then i started beating myself up for not drawing. Schools are reopening soon(I am online btw, finally got that uncapped shit) which means less drawing. I do not want to be a robot that just gets the A's without learning anything, but my moms not seeing it, she is putting more pressure on me, ensuring i have no me time. Right now, I am contemplating suicide, that way I do not feel the pain of school anymore, any before you give me the ""suicide hurts your loved ones speech"", just remember that you get what you give, so if my loved ones give pain, then they will get it.I do not want to be rebellious and be a prick, there is no way I am running away now, winter nights are just too cold. summers coming though, and I am not about to put in effort into something that drains me again. What do I do redditors. Advise me, should just end me or should I walk the path of pain.? My apologies if the text is too long, I just needed you guys to be well informed before advising me. I need advice.",1
Having weird thoughts I'd share (don't worry not suicidal) Do you ever have that weird feeling where you just have that fear of getting to attached to someone or something? Like you get this thrill like yes finally something good happened but then in the back of your mind your just scared of something bad happening before you know you'll screw it up or something bad will always repeat? I found out I'm moving again and I've lost track how many times I've moved and I recently got this job a few months ago and I am in love with it and I'm scared that I don't find anything similar to it when I move and another thing I'm just scared to lose the people I'm close too all over again. It seems like it's always like that the people I love the most go the farthest away. I've lost a of people in my life and opportunities and I'm scared this is another one of those things. I wish I had a place called home where I can settle and do what I love with the people I love. Sorry for the vent I just needed to let it out I guess.,1
"finally, you put the ball into a hole in the ground.",0
I live with my family and I have just gone quiet. I do not talk much about anything because the thoughts on my head do not make for good conversation. I have stopped taking to a lot of people last year bc i felt they were not good friends for me and i was right i just do not have other friends to talk to. I do have one tho i game with but i have trouble talking about feelings with him too. I do not want advice when i talk to someone i guess that is why i do not. I do not want to be told to get out more and talk to strangers because i do not know how to do that. Or join clubs bc i already know that is a good way to meet people. but I am just discouraged the people i really like move away and we lose touch and i do not like that many types of people :( I just constantly listen to podcasts to fill the time when I am working on stuff but myself or gaming. I always feel like an outsider and i think being alone most of the time is making me worse at making friends. I do not even know what to do with friends like to hangout. Like if i want to hangout with another new guy friend my age (24) i do not really know what to plan. And i do not really want to do anything either. It feels so weird to try and make friends it feels easier to ask someone out on a date than ask them to hangout as friends. I do not talk,1

"And I keep asking myself, ""Have I done enough?"" ""Am I a good man?"" I have been up and down, and down and up the past couple of weeks. I have done good things, I know. Left the cult I was raised in. Got out of an abusive relationship that went on for years and years afterwards. Rebuilt my life from ground up a few years ago. Am loved by my children, and I am in reasonable health for someone of my age.I have got all these good things, but the questions of worth keep haunting me, along with flashes of absolute screaming terror at the thought of non-existence. Of not being. I was diagnosed with long term, mid-grade depression back in my 30s. SSRIs have been used in the past, but they ate too much of my quality of life and therapy has been of limited use. So, this is a fight that I have fought before.I just do not know how to face the growing dissolution of my physical being combined with the worry that I just do not measure up to what I should be. I do not know how to beat back having a thousand yard stare into an eternity of ""I failed."" I will be 55 on Sunday.",1

"My every day is a living hell. I can never find the motivation to get out of bed for my own sake, but I love my siblings so I have to force myself to get up, smile, and bear it just for them. All I do is game, watch anime, and browse reddit because it is all I have the mental strength to do. I have not had a true friend in years and my last 3 relationships ended badly, leaving me with mental scars that make my hope for finding a new partner next to none.I am unlikable, period. So many problems, an ugly body and a fucked-up personality. there is no way anyone will ever truly love me, and I am tired of being lied to. I am afraid to trust people because I have been hurt so many times by people I trusted and loved. But even so...I need someone. A boyfriend who would talk to me when I need support, call me just so I could hear his voice when I feel lonely, who would hold me when I cry and so on, but those people only exist in fantasy. they are not real, I have never met one and I do not think I ever will. The only time I ever get to coexist with that kind of person is when I am asleep, dreaming. And even then when I wake up, they are gone, and I have to cling to the memory like water in my cupped hands until it is gone. I have found and lost love so many times because of these dreams that taunt me. I am starting to think it would be best if I just never woke up so I could continue dreaming forerver. I am tired of being tortured like this, guys. Without a partner or friends I do not think it is worth it. Yet I am too afraid to kill myself, I am a coward and I hate myself in every way possible. I doubt I will even get replies. I can only be happy in my dreams",1
"This is very important to me so if anyone could help it would be very appreciated We love each other to pieces.. but we fight a lot, find it hard to understand each other, have a lot of temper tantrums when speaking about more sensitive topics and cannot seem to find a way to talk about more sensitive things without it becoming a fight.

"My parents expect nothing less than a perfect ubermensch of a son out of me. They want me to make straight A's, ace college, graduate with a prestigious degree, and then get some high-paying job to make big bucks. Part of it is because they never did quite reach those levels of wealth. But the rest is just them having vastly overblown expectations.I cannot handle it anymore. I do not have any marketable skills. I am an asocial introvert with *one* friend who does not go to college. I have pretty much given up. I do not have any drive, motivation, or *anything* now.

Anything that requires more effort than browsing the internet in a mindless haze is excruciatingly draining on my mind.

I *wish* it hurt. Pain is a *feeling*. You can focus on *pain*. What I feel is a dull ache, like part of myself is *missing*.I have realized that I will never live up to my parent's expectations.

"I (33 old man now) lost my first love about 5 years ago. I loved everything about her except she was not really into sex. As happy as I was, that kept on nailing into me and my depression plummeted me when I was in forced training at my work to have to work 100+ hour weeks. I am the second generation of that, so I credit most of my mental illness to my busted up childhood as a result. So I transformed into a shitty person from all of the anxiety of potentially being absent for her, like I had done to me that she eventually got rid of me and never looked back. I was erased from her life with such ease.I entered another relationship about 2 1/2 years ago but I was not fully over my first and she had her mental issues as well. I finally lost her recently because I am so on autopilot and ""do not put in enough effort"".They were both gorgeous women and I will never get them, their caliber or my youth back again.. I am on online dating.... Again.. And there is nothing but overweight and heavily tattooed women that were nothing like my exes... The best part is, I do not get a fart of interest anymore. It was hard before, but there was still something.. But now I do not even get a glance by the dumpster selection... Knowing that my relationship and romantic life is behind me forever, I am having panic attacks and crying nightly. But in reality, should us depressed people even date? People do not give a fuck about us.. And more often than not, we will let them down... And then they will leave like they always do.. Even when we think we are fixed up, this shit just comes right back.. Because of my depression, I am boring, I am toxic, I am neurotic, I am needy, I am anxious, I am awkward, not well rounded in life... I always knew I needed someone to compliment me, but should we even be doing that when we are so broken? I guess I need to think harder about suicide. There not much bigger disappointment in life than being a man and not being able to attract anyone. Are we meant to date?",1

"Stress won't let me sleep properly TL;DR: Can't sleep due to stress. Example for today is waiting on a person to send their part of a group project and it likely won't be sent until the morning but can't turn off my brain to sleep tonight because I want to finish all objective for today and then I can sleep. Need help to fix this way of thinking.

Whenever I become stressed I either don't sleep or keep on waking up every hour roughly for a good while and then ultimately wake up in the morning absolutely exhausted. Take today for example I'm laying in bed stressed over a college assignment because I'm still waiting for one member to send his part to me so it can be added to the PowerPoint. It's due tomorrow evening and instead of just accepting I'll have to wait for it to be sent to me tomorrow morning or afternoon all I can think is ""I want to have it now so I can finish the project and then turn my brain off."" I can't turn my brain off until all objectives are done for that day. The objective was to submit this group project and since how I can't do it I've started stressing out and thus now I can't sleep. I hate that I'm like this and just want help on how to solve this flawed way of thinking.",3

Nothing brings me joy, I have no hobbies and have no desire to pick new ones up. I have tried to force myself to do *anything* and I just get angry and frustrated. Even my last few safe hobbies are now boring. I do not want to go to the gym, or read a book, or go for a walk, or write, or draw. I am so mind numbingly bored that I feel like a caged animal. I sit in my room and scratch and rub at my skin, hit head and legs, roll around on my bed as if I am in agony. I feel like I am going insane, and if this carries on I will go insane. I just want this to end but I do not even have the balls to kill myself. One minute I want to cry and the next I want to smash my head so hard against a wall that it fractures me skull. What the fuck do I even do now. I cannot do this anymore. Absolutely nothing brings me enjoyment anymore. I have no hobbies, nor do I want to I begin scratching at myself and hitting myself and rolling around like I am possessed. I am so mind numbingly bored I am so bored I feel like a caged animal, I just want to die. I cannot live like this.",1

I have been trying to get my mom to help me find help for it but she insists that there is nothing wrong with me and I am just sad every once in a while. Therapy is extremely expensive where I live and I do not know if my insurance will cover it.

"I (20M) have parents that I have not been able to get along with since I was a teen, without completely just shutting off my personality, opinions, etc. Whenever I talk about anything outside of trivial things it is bound to end in an argument where I am always wrong, even when it comes to my own body and future. I have lived through a narcissistic dad and a mom who has been through a lot of trauma with him (although I do not even know what to think about that because the abuse repeats itself again and again). I want nothing more than to limit contact with them but they are the ones paying for my uni and because of some family circumstances I cannot hold down a job and move out. But whenever I am around them my mental health suffers worse than usual. I feel completely stuck in my life with nowhere to go and I would not mind if something just took me out one day out of the blue. I wish I was not born very often and I cannot see any positive way out if I am being completely honest.

I have suicidal thoughts everyday, multiple times a day, but I struggle to talk about this because even if I am almost sure that I will never act on it because I have hope that someday I will be if not okay, al least better, I cannot convince others of that. I feel like I am slowing becoming more and more difficult to be with, I am terrified of that. They always say ""a good friend/boyfriend does not leave you just because you are struggling"" but it happened to me before, how can I ignore that? I do not want to be a burden. All I want is to be happy, or at least stable, and to be a source of happiness to others.

"Anxiety &amp; heart problems.. How do I tell if it’s my anxiety/stress causing my heart palpitations or if I have an actual heart problem? Brief background - Changed my SSRI back in November (Bad idea) didn’t suit me at all, sent me into a depression rut &amp; only just started back on my old meds again. Starting to climb out of this rut now however I still get bad palpitations on/off when I’m feeling anxious/stressed but sometimes I can just be lying in bed or walking around &amp; get them when I don’t feel any anxiety present. Once I get them it triggers my anxiety because I fear something is awfully wrong &amp; that I’ll have a heart attack etc. I definitely have cardiophobia &amp; I’m always fixated on my heart (convinced something is wrong) I had my bloods done last week &amp; they were fine &amp; tomorrow I get an ECG but I’m scared if I have afib or arrhythmia issues they won’t pick it up because I’ve heard they are difficult to detect. From an outsider looking in do you think I have a real heart problem or do you think my palpitations are all anxiety/stress related?",2

The thing is though, I don't feel anxious or anything though, I just have this one symptom.. is this just as bad as being full-on stressed?

Is she doing well"". I have been sitting with bottled up emotions for almost a year without having the ability to talk to her. I miss her, I want to talk to her, I want to see her, I want to know that she is ok, I want to smell that mango flavor lip balm she had and most importantly, I just want to hold her close and know that she is safe.

"I was diagnosed with severe chronic depression at a young age. Since then, my illness has morphed into an unmanageable mess. Schizophrenia, paranoia and BPD are things I now live with and it is absolutely hell. I am 28 now. The road here has been destroyed and the bridges to other outlets have been burned and pissed on by yours truly. I have not had a proper conversation with someone in almost 2 years. I do not know how to communicate anymore. If I say anything to anyone, I am not sure if what I am saying means anything anymore. Everyday I tell myself I am worthless. I am stupid. Nothing. Waste. it is hilarious because I do this to calm myself down when I get to emotional. I have zero self-esteem. It just left one day. Perpetually, I keep myself from feeling any form of positive attitude towards myself, others and things I once held as ""good"" in my life. I do not understand. If I can, I distract myself with noise. Music, video games, fans, my leaking faucet and internal. Without these things I hear the bullshit. The people. The talking. The laughing. The eyes. I hate it. I fucking hate it so much. It makes me want to cry just thinking about it. They cannot be real. None of it could be. The world's not out to get me. That cannot possibly be the case. that is stupid. But for some reason, me thinking is not enough. Why? Why not? ""Take the medicine. It will make the pain go away."" ""Oops! Wrong medicine! Try another."" ""Oops! What about this one?"" Feel better? Worse? Hmm"" ""it is been a couple of months now. This forth medication should have started working. Are you actually taking it? Yes? Well, oops! let us try again shall we?"" "" What do you mean you do not want anymore medication?! it is the only thing that can make you feel better!"" ""Look, I know that you feel taking meds is pointless but it is not! Some people's brains just do not behave normally. it is normal. You just have to take meds the rest of your life to be able to go outside and be a normal, happy person. do not you want that?"" ""Sorry to see you go. Call if you would like to come back and try again. What are you going to do now?"" Everyday it is something new but the same old thing. I try to fill my life with material things to fill the space inside of me that something left behind. The problem is, I do not know what it was. And because of that I cannot find the proper thing to replace it. It cannot be just anything. It has to be a replica of what I lost. I have tried finding it but everything and everyone does not fit. It makes me wonder if I am lost and that piece of me is on the hunt. An issue comes up though. I am hiding. I have buried myself so far out of reach from anything real. That thing will never find me. I do not want to be found. I am scared. I do not want it to come back. I do not know. I do not know anything anymore. what is the point of having friends if I am not pleasant to be around? what is the point of leaving my apartment if I cannot enjoy being outside? Why care so much about what other people think of me if I think so negatively about myself? Why try? I have never done anything, worth anything, in 28 years. I have never put myself into anything 100%. Never. I have never tried to complete anything in life. I give up. that is what I am good at. Giving up. All the things I have done. All the people I have hurt. All the potential I have wasted. All the doors that I have slammed, viciously, in opportunities face. All the emotions I have drowned. All the delusions I suffer. The one person I should have cared most about in this world has given up on me. Me. I gave up on me. I am tired. This is the most tired I have been in ages. I feel like I have lived a thousand life times and died a thousand more. I am not who I once was. I am a completely different person. I do not know who I am. I do not think I ever will. I have so much to think about and I do not know how to say the things I feel. I am finished. Even though I understand I am Ill, I do not. Understand?",1
"My dad always says it is all about perspective. We all have our windows through which we see the world, and our reality is how we chose to perceive it. Sometimes, even the most complex problem just requires a shift in perspective, or a view through another person's window, before it can be solved with ease.I have given up on life. I am not quite sure how to describe it, I guess it is just one of those things you know, like when you are in love, when you are hungry or just need the loo. I suppose the symptoms are easily identifiable: apathy, melancholy, depression, fatigue, lethargy, etc, but there is a less-medical term that I think describes it better: my light has gone out.Who I am does not really matter, though for completeness's sake my executive summary details are: 21 Male, 2nd Year Engineering student from South Africa, caucasian with Danish and English ancestry, single, always have been, probably on the spectrum, no friends anymore.I have buried my best and closest friend, and another four friends over the past five years. I have been wrongfully accused of a crime that I never committed, which took the system a year of intimidation, court rooms and sever depression and anxiety to determine that she had made it all up. I have been a victim of extortion, blackmail and cybercrimes, involving intimidation, fear and had no one to talk to. I am the eldest of three, and the eldest of my family's generation and link that keeps my stressed-out family together. I have felt the feeling of loving another, but never the feeling of it being mutual. I was once a happy child in a happy house with a dream of changing the world, and the aptitude to do it. But today, I do not see the point of it all. My friends are dead, the person I am in love with, and the only person I have every loved, does not feel the same way. I have horrors tormenting me each night that I cannot tell anyone about, I am half way through second year and I have only been on campus for four weeks before lockdown, I do not have much money, I have lost focus on studies altogether and I am only 21 years old.Perspective. The only thing my sorry engineering mind could come up with was getting a different perspective on things, and maybe, just maybe I might find a path that will lead me to, well, enlightenment (i.e. to get the light back).You obviously do not know me from a bar of soap, but maybe I need impersonal advice, I do not know. As the title suggests, despite living in the tech world since before I could walk, this is my first and only online post.

ok, so Me(24M) have been with my gf(25F) for a little over three years. We have had a very very difficult relationship! Recently have found out that she has BPD! We have had problems with being “intimate” with each other for majority of the relationship! She had given birth to her kid just a few months before we got together, so I figured it was post partom. Granted I have been a bit understanding not the best but I’ve tried very hard. However, it will be 4 years soon since she’s had him so I’m not understanding as much now as to why it’s such an issue to want me! We will have literal fights about it cause I feel like I’m not loved or wanted! She always tells me it’s not me and it’s just her head, but as a person who has A LOT of mental disorders I just can’t seem to believe her! So now she gets diagnosed with BPD, and I’m wondering if this would have an effect on her sex drive also! I also have BPD but I still have a sex drive… It’s getting to the point that I want to leave the relationship, cause I’m not getting what I need! I have a  VERY high sex drive and she was told about this when we started dating! I love her with everything in me and would love to spend the rest of my life with her and our child.

"Hello everyone, I need advice how to help my sister. Some ground informations: my sister is still a teenager and got diagnosed with depression. She is visiting a therapist twice a week and takes medication. Let me describe what happened today. We went shopping bought many things and she was obviously very delighted. You could tell by her body language and her speech. She also mentioned it herself once after obtaining a certain item.But when we were on our way home she started going quiet and was holding tears back. She did not reach out in anyway, instead put some music on and was quiet. I am not sure what to do and let her have her peace without me asking to much questions.But events like these happen occasionally and she would attempt to hurt herself under her arms in an attempt to hide these. I am seriously thinking what I can do to help her someway in these situations but the only thing that comes to my mind is to leave her in peace without disturbing her. Am I doing something wrong or should I behave differently? I thank you all in advance for your possible advice! I need advice how to act",1

I am tired all the time and fed up with the world. I want to disengage from it; already isolated myself from most my friends. Before I felt isolated from my age group because I was too childish, but now I feel isolated because I feel too old for /all this/. I feel like my life is nearing its end and I do not want to go on. I just go day to day without doing much at all because things do not excite me like they used to. Sometimes I look in the mirror and check if I am growing wrinkles or white hair because I wonder if my outside will reflect my inside. Why do I feel old? Did something happen to my psychology? Before I felt like a sad child inside but now I feel like an old man waiting to die. Why did I miss the middle stage of growing up?

"Been in an extremely high anxious state the past five days (had multiple sobbing breakdowns as well), suddenly got weird “buzzing” feeling deep in one part of my brain? I’ve looked this up, and heard of the term “brain zaps” that can be triggered by extreme stress. But all of this info is from sketchier websites so I can’t be sure. Is this a real thing? Or do I have to be worried about some other health issue lmao??

It feels like a mini phone vibrating on pulses, deep in my brain in one located spot. (More to the right of my head.)

I also look at screens a LOT, like 90% of my day, and I know that’s  also a huge health issue but I’m not sure if that’s what’s causing this.",3

For all of us neglected and alone today try to stay off Facebook to look at your supposed ex friends or exes posts I just found out my exes daughter is friends now with his new loves hairdresser who introduced him to her before our divorce. why would she be friends with her? Her own marriage is failing and I hope it does so she can see what it feels like Seems like everybodys having a big old circle jerk as I sit in my room all by myself in the dark 4th,1
I can usually tell when my depression is slowly starting to become a more prominent feature in my day to day life by how much I am looking forward to going to bed. When one of my first thoughts in the morning is one of returning to sleep not in that moment but at the end of the day. That is a fairly strong indicator for me. My sense of self worth plummets even lower than usual and my mind starts to slowly but surely focus on dark thoughts. Something that seems unthinkable during more normative times suddenly starts to feel like an excellent idea and the most logical solution. Hopefully this time things will be different.

"Its been 4 months since he was told he needed to find somewhere else to go, but hes still in the family home while everythings getting sorted out - because COVID! When I am in the same room with him I get weepy and irritable and sometimes have panic attacks! My GP gave me antidepressants for the first time in my life, to tide me over - I was on the maximum dose of 15 tablets a day - but they had too many side effects so I had to ween myself off them. And I have lost 15kgs in the last 4 months from stress! I know if I can just dig deep, Ill soon be free of my dad forever! I am definitely going No Contact with him!The second he walks out that door I am going to ask my crush on a date. These last 4 months I have been terrified - and still am - that she will get a boyfriend in the meantime! I know I should seize my chance now, but I do not want to do it till I am free. I am not in the right frame of mind at the moment - I am in survival mode. The thought of that momentous day, when I can tell her how I feel, is the ONE THING that keeps me going!!Please guys, send me good energy and pray that my crush stays single a little while longer! As soon as my dad leaves the family home I am going to ask my crush on a date, but its been 4 months and he still has not left!",1
"I want to tell my story before I die. I have dealt with mental health issues my whole life. I have tried harder than anyone can expect or should need to. My earliest memories are of my father coming home drunk and high. Beating my mother. I would hide under the bed and play dolls with my sister. So she would not hear him beating her. I always wanted friends but never had any. I was the weird kid. I could not go into anyone's house unless invited. I remember peeing my pants outside the door because I was not invited in. I remember my father living 20 minutes down the road but never being there. Only holidays to look good in front of his parents. I remember my mother's family hating me. Telling me I would be just like him. How men are worthless. My stepfather beating me. How they would blame me and say I was lying. I remember being kicked out of the house while still in school for defending her when he raised a fist at her. Hitting him. Making him cry for his mom. I am not a good person I get it. I remember being homeless. I remember meeting my wife at my second job. Breaking into my grandparents house while they were gone for the winter. Drinking too much because I just wanted it to stop and the blackouts gave me peace. I remember the few years of happiness I had with my wife. Well as close to as someone like me can have. I remember us going to school and planning a future. I was going to be a chef. She wanted to be a writer. I remember the knock on my door. Hearing she was not ok. The hospital. Seeing her. Them telling me to call her family. Calling them. Not knowing what to say. She got a headache at work. She just started crying after sitting down and passed out they said. They sent her to a bigger better hospital. I remember driving there. I drove so fast. Reckless. They took her by helicopter. They did tests. I remember they told me she had an aneurysm. She was brain dead. Them asking me to sign papers to have her unplugged. To donate her organs. Her brother wanting her father to see her again. Her father that molested her. That molested more than her. Went to prison for it. I remember stalling so he could see her. I do not know if that was the right thing to do. I hated him. But she was his daughter. And for some reason it was important to her brother. I remember he was not supposed to touch her. I remember him touching her anyways. I remember breaking. I was already broken. I have been bipolar my whole life. I remember signing the papers to take her off life support. Not being able to be there when she passed. It was too much. I apologize. I was a kid. I could only handle so much. I was 23. I killed her with the stroke of a pen. You can say she was brain dead and already dead. But that was what ended it. I remember getting mail that told me about how her organs saved lives. Calling her family, even her father to them. I do not remember the next few years well. I drank a lot. I was trying to kill myself. I stayed with her family some and mine. I made unforgivable mistakes. I got angry. I came close to killing. I remember pulling a knife. I was going to commit suicide by cop. I remember the multiple times I tried to get help. I remember giving up. Going to a group home. Just hoping. I would get help. Trying so many medications. Counseling. Being left to rot. I spent near a decade there. I tried anything they offered. I failed me. They failed me as well. Never following through. Promising things that never happened. The group home was infested with bed bugs and cockroaches. Covered in bites always. My roommates all needed help that none of us got. I was jumped and had teeth broken out for being mistaken for one that was a sexual offender. After years of trying I had to leave as another was bringing weapons into the house. we would drink together. he would pull out one. Tell me if I did not kill him with it he would kill me then himself. I went to stay with my mom. I am having trouble typing more. I just need a break. I can finish later if anyone wants. My story or as much as I could write.",1

Am i having a seizure? I have been having extreme HA for the past month but in the last week i have been having really weird symptoms.

"A little while and you will no longer see me; again a little while and you will see me.Then some of his disciples said to one another, What is this hes telling us: A little while and you will not see me; again a little while and you will see me and, because I am going to the Father? They said, What is this he is saying, A little while? We do not know what hes talking about. Jesus knew they wanted to ask him, and so he said to them, Are you asking one another about what I said, A little while and you will not see me; again a little while and you will see me? Truly I tell you, you will weep and mourn, but the world will rejoice. You will become sorrowful, but your sorrow will turn to joy. When a woman is in labor, she has pain because her time has come. But when she has given birth to a child, she no longer remembers the suffering because of the joy that a person has been born into the world. So you also have sorrowfn now. But I will see you again. Your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take away your joy from you. In that day you will not ask me anything. Truly I tell you, anything you ask the Father in my name, he will give you. Until now you have asked for nothing in my name. Ask and you will receive, so that your joy may be complete. Sorrow Turned to Joy",1

"I am writing on behalf of my friend and colleague (with his permission) who has watched his daughter Laney steadily deteriorate after suddenly suffering massive strokes due to a disease known as Moya Moya, which is where the body tries to compensate for inadequate bloodflow to the brain by sending capillaries that invariably burst. She is now in terminal condition and the family is facing a staggering mountain of medical bills. The icing on the cake is that the onset of the strokes occured while Laney's mom was 8 month's pregnant. The last year and a half has been horrific. I've posted the [link to a GoFundMe <url> started by Laney's Godmother in the hopes that there may be some of you who would like to contribute.",0
"Tell me your success stories Quick Bio:
My Dad was diagnosed with MS when I was 23, shortly after having my first baby. It rocked my world. I saw the strongest man in my life quickly deteriorating and it hit me that illnesses happen to young people. This kicked off health anxiety for me and I’ve been struggling ever since. I’ve been convinced that I’ve had MS, Parkinson’s, neuro diseases. lots of various cancers. I’m a compulsive ‘checker’ if I feel a lump or bump. I check it constantly. I’ve had panic attacks that last for days. Most of these symptoms have always gone away with starting and restarting ssri’s.  Basically, my anxiety has given me symptoms that mimic diseases. My mind is obviously not healthy, as if I even hear the word cancer, I can feel the anxiety build. If people I know are going through something health related, or even if I see a young person going through cancer treatment, it triggers it. It’s even branching to my kids. Every headache or complaint, I start panicking about something worse than a headache or virus. I can’t sleep, I obsess and they’re starting to notice my compulsions and worries. It’s entirely illogical and overall just really bad for my health. I don’t want to live like this. I hate being on SSRI’s. I have sexual side effects and I don’t feel like myself. I think they help, but even on them I’m susceptible to panic over things. 

I’ve tried meditating, medications, yoga, exercise. I’ve overhauled my diet. I lift weights and cardio 3x a week. I use CBD oil. 

My question: is this a life long thing? Has anyone overcome this and lived more normally? Has therapy helped you? And if so, how? I just don’t see how talking about it will help. How have you overcome this? I’m so tired. ",2
"...because I can never get good at anything. If I pick up a hobby, I do it for a few weeks, then hit an obstacle or get bored of it and just give up. This has been happening for years. For example: I started drawing multiple times and I am still about as good as a toddler. No matter what I try, I cannot stick with anything ever. I think it has to do with the executive function in my brain being banged up, I cannot organise myself. it is frustrating nonetheless as it is really all my fault, because I know I could have been good if only I pushed myself more. I get these depressive episodes where I hardly do anything but eat and sleep and those days could have been spent doing something actually worthwhile. Feel like such a loser...",1
hello i am year old and a senior in high school i also have adhd and autism i have been suicidal twice before th th grade and 0th grade but this is possibly the worst it s been the disaster started back in september when i got diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder called nf everything i have heard about this disorder from doctor and online sound fucking horrible and nothing i want to live with then in october i met my first girlfriend so i wa happy for a bit but if course that went south too i ll just get right to the point when the relationship started i made clear to her that i didn t want sex and she agreed however later that same month she talked me into it in november december she asked for it multiple time a day and guilt tripped me when i said no she made me feel horrible when she did this then in january i wa saying no repeatedly and she just pulled my pant down and started riding me even though i wa trying to push her off and safe wording i broke up with her in february but there s been drama and social bullshit ever sense in addition recently i got in an apartment fire for the second time in my life this caused me to lose all my belonging they are allegedly being cleaned but it s taking for fucking ever this mean i don t have many of my coping mechanism which is only adding to the stress we had to stay at a hotel for a few night and now we re in a new apartment but it s not the same but that s not all my shitty life ha to offer in addition i have medical debt i also tried calling the suicide hotline the other day and the lady on the phone said what do you want me to do about it and later she hung up on me even aside from all the stuff i mentioned there s several more recent incident i m just to emotional to type it all up now i honestly don t know what to do i keep thinking that thing will get better soon but the only get worse,1

"3 weeks ago I had everything. I was doing better finally after a long depressive period. I made one mistake and now I have messed up my vision. I am so sad that god is not real or that if he is he will not give us one do over. Its so hard to accept this new status quo. When I was younger I would not have made this mistake, things just get worse and worse. I had one day of happiness and I ruined my future. I wish so badly that god were real and he would help me or allow a way to fix my mistake. I kind of wish I were dead, but I am trying to hang on until I get antidepressants. I am tired of feeling this way. I can never go back and there is no one to help me or others in this situation. All we have is blind faith/hope that in the future there will be help for us.

"My journey was not easy, and it is not over yet. But I am better, something I still cannot believe today. Anyways, here are principles that I have come to realize and want to share to everyone in the hopes that these will get you out.1. Family is what you make it. Choose them, not stick with them. But be civil still2. People around you are either one of these two: people to nurture/love or objects to use. When I said objects to use, I mean those people that drag you down or does not think of you as important. You should not let them affect you but make the most use of them.3. Just go with what life throws. Be stubborn. If you want something to happen, just keep doing it. you will either die trying and sad or be happy when you finally get what you want. Either way, you get something you want. Either healing or death.4. Make the most of your strengths. This includes faking, pain tolerance (emotional) etc. These things are our demons but we can use these to our advantage. Remember, there are two kinds of successful people. Those who made it by shining bright, and those who made it quietly, in the shadows. Positive and negative. I know this may be confusing, as English is not my first language. This may also sound bitter. But hey, this got me out. Take it with a grain of salt. What I learned throughout my journey to overcome depression",1

"Hi, hoping this will make me feel better. This summer has been hard. I am medicated for anxiety/depression, have a partner I love and that is so supportive, a dog that means everything to me and a safe place to live but it still feels impossible to be happy most days. I work as an RDH and that has taken a toll, especially since COVID- its exhausting. I like the perspective my job gives me, I have a great boss and coworkers but having to always be on for patients is SO draining when I feel like shit myself. Its important to me to be an empathetic provider/provide positive experiences so that is probably the hardest part. I get a lot of nervous, anxious / patients in pain and I feel like a sponge- all that gets soaked up. I wish I lived somewhere else so I felt like I am not here to pay off debt until I die. Parents are retiring soon and I just think welp, that will never be me. cannot afford good enough medical insurance to get quality care, nothing is/has ever been worth the copay. I used to want to have kids to give them the ~happy childhood~ I did not have but why add another burden to the planet. The future is not sustainable. Country is legit on fire, nature is dying. Basic truths or facts do not matter anymorejust stupid ass culture wars to bring in ratings and profit. I remember thinking the first time I wanted to die was when I was 8.

"I hate my life. As the title states, I hate my fucking life. There is nothing redeemable or meaningful about my existence. I clean toilets for just above minimum wage to get by. Everyday is a sisyphean nightmare, I scrub the literal shit just for there to be more shit. Endless shit, such is life. It’s funny because everyone tells me I can do so much more, but is that truly so? I hate everything about everything yet have no real motivation to change. I’m just so tired all the time. 

Little background to paint the pathetic picture, I’m in my late twenties and live with my parents. I’ve had no remaining friends for several years now (for the better), have had a suspended license for 4 years, and my only sibling hasn’t talked to me in years. My parents and girlfriend are the last remaining positive things in my life, yet personal guilt blocks my appreciation of them. I honestly don’t deserve them. 

Why they haven’t discarded me like everyone else is beyond me. I’m a pathetic, self-absorbed, alcoholic blister. The only time I don’t experience crippling anxiety and the hollowness of my self- inflicted sadness is when skirting the line of a blackout. I have embarrassed my girlfriend and parents countless times. Despite my best efforts, I’m not a likeable person, even when sober. I hate that I have to not drink two days a week, otherwise the familiar beast of physical dependence comes knocking on my decrepit door. 

I’m not sure why I’m even bothering to write all this. It’s not like I’m capable or even worthy of change. I got cleaned up and worked a 12 step program rigorously for over a year in the past. Tried to convince myself that I could even make healthy friends and live a normal life. I also went on Prozac, which made only a negligible difference except for the broken dick. That facade quickly crumbled once I realized that people like me are simply not meant to be happy. I lived in nothing more than a hopeful fantasy all that time. 

In the end there isn’t much else to say. Life just isn’t fair, and I haven’t the energy to even complain anymore. The 18 yearold who locked 13 yearold me in his garage and shot me with a BB gun is a rich corporate lawyer. The highschool team-mate who regularly beat my ass is an investment manager for Merryl Lynch. If there weren’t losers like me, then there wouldn’t be winners like them.",1
"Feelings of worthlessness, criticising myself all the time, mood-swings due to severe self-loathing, insomnia, isolation, regret over past mistakes (mainly due to alcoholism), so angry im grinding my teeth constantly, unable to exercise due to illnesses and injury, snapping at people I have no idea how to continue, I'm fed up beyond belief and feel I have nowhere to turn. I feel like I can't continue anymore",1
"No one takes my anxiety seriously. In my family, it is no secret that I struggle with severe anxiety. I do not want to give too much detail, but they do little things that make me feel like they really do not give a crap about my anxiety. Like how I hate taking pictures, especially with other people, because I feel self-conscious and literally feel like the ugliest person alive. I told them about it and they apparently understood. Then a few days later they force me (Literally pull me by the arm) to be in a picture with them that is not even important and I instantly lost all my trust in them.I remember running to my room afterward and bawling my eyes out. I did not even want to look at the picture. I know it is not even that big of a deal, but it really affected my ability to open up to people because I felt that no matter how supportive they act, they will never really take anything I say or feel seriously and I just felt like the biggest wuss ever because, I mean, it is just a picture, right? why the hell am I so scared of a picture?Of course, this is not the only thing I am dealing with. I really hope I am not the only one that is going through this, but I do not feel human anymore. It feels like my mind has detached from my body. I do not feel present. It feels like I am floating and like I am not alive. Idk how to explain this, but it gets even worse during stressful situations. I do not know what I want anymore. It feels like my body is trying to tell me something but I do not know what it is.I remember when it started. I had just had the biggest mental breakdown I had ever had and I just went numb afterward and that numbness has not gone away since.I do not know man. Life is just so fricking tiring and lonely. Just venting",1
i am finally going to make an appointment monday to talk to a doctor about my anxiety but i already have so much anxiety about even calling to make the appointment i m tired of feeling like not only my mind but my entire body is on edge just waiting for something to happen yet i know my blood pressure will be high and my pulse will skyrocket when i talk to the nurse doctor and i m dreading it any tip on helping anxiety about talking to a doctor about medicine for anxiety i also don t want them to think that i m just wanting drug or am being dramatic i have tried to manage it myself for the past few month but i feel no better,1
"My health anxiety is spiralling I just got back from an eye check up for a new set of contact lenses and the optometrist told me my eyes are healthy and I just have a few eye freckles (they’re on the whites of my eyes and are light grey). After the appointment, KNOWING he said my eyes were fine, I went into a rabbit hole and googled eye freckles and found out that in rare circumstances they can turn cancerous. 

I felt sick to my stomach and want to go back to an optometrist to get them removed but I know I’m sending myself into a spiral. It’s been about two hours now and I’m starting to calm down about it all, trying to tell myself that if anything was wrong I would be told. But I hate this. My brain has to focus on the worst outcome possible. 

Planning to speak to somebody about my healthy anxiety because I feel like it’s getting worse as time goes on. But it sucks.",2

"ALS Fear Sending My Life In A Downward Spiral. I don't know where to to turn other then to people who may be able to relate to me. Every second of the day lately I have it in my head that I am going to pass away from ALS shortly. 

It all started about 1 - 2 weeks ago. I started having muscle twitches in my right arm and right thigh, and when I bend over to pick something up or when I squat, my right thigh muscles twitch and tremor uncontrollably. A few google searches later, ""ALS"" is popping up all over the place. It's been a constant worry now with every 5 - 10 minutes me getting up out of my chair to ""test my strength"" in my right leg. But every time I squat or try to balance on my right leg and bend at the knee, the tremors and twitches trigger in my right thigh like crazy. I have really horrible HMO insurance and it takes anywhere from 3-5 weeks for me to see a Primary Care Physician. I have an appointment for 4 weeks from now with my PCP. But until then all I can do is sit back and hope for the best but expect the worst. 

I am in in a massive downward spiral now. I can't do anything but sit on my computer and research ALS. I don't want to go anywhere or do anything because in my head I want life to move as slowly as possible just incase I have not a lot of time left on this earth. I don't know where else to turn. I am so so so scared. (28 year old Male).

"2 week depression episode Hi Everyone,

I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety last year, but had probably been dealing with it my whole life.

I have a handful of medications that have helped me a lot, but occasionally I get these slumps of depression still.

Before they always seemed to line up with PMS so I attributed them to that, but this one is on the opposite part of my cycle. I feel like I'm wasting my cycles best time!

Anyway, I'm struggling to find a trigger. Was there a trigger? I'll obviously discuss this with my psychiatrist, but I don't know. 

I guess I just want to hear other's experiences with this type of episode. I went from high energy and cooking dinner to not being able to shower or work? I felt disconnected from my partner, like we were more in an arrangement to be married, not in love. That sounds awful, but my emotions just weren't there. I think I'm coming out of it now, I took a shower, got my eyebrows done, and had my legs waxed. Maybe I'll pay to get a Mani/Pedi. 

Thank you for reading my ramble. 
Is this just life with depression?",1

I grew up poor. Very poor actually. We were never able to travel for breaks or anything. Bologna sandwiches and noodles were common dinners and sometimes it was crackers and water if we were really struggling. One time we even went almost a year without electricity. I am 25 now and obviously I am still struggling with PTSD from those days. Sometimes I convince myself that maybe I would not hate life so much if I had money. Its stupid and I know money does not fix everything but dammit Id rather cry in a nice house with money in the bank than in a dark room in a house that is falling apart. I am dumb enough to think that my mental illnesses will be more tolerable if I had money.,1

"Sudden painful lump in buccal mucosa area sort of behind wisdom tooth, should I be freaking out? On Friday after finishing a week long dose of antibiotics I began to feel discomfort when moving my jaw. I felt around yesterday and noticed a raised area or lump at the very back of my upper mouth, deep on the side of my wisdom tooth, in the buccal mucosa area as they call it. It's on the lining of the cheek in a weird sort of muscular pocket that moves when you move your jaw, hence the pain.

Would cancer grow this quickly? I'm quite sure this lump wasn't there before. Salt water rinses do burn a little as though it's an ulcer or something, but I don't typically get mouth ulcers so I'm unsure. ",2

"Hi all,I have lived with depression all my life (35), over that time I have had some really low points and struggled a lot, there have been times when I have been on the edge of that dark place thinking about ending things. But somehow I have always come back from it. But this last few months I have gone through more pain and emotional trauma than I have ever had to try and cope with, because of that and how I have been I lost my best friend, the person I cared most about in this world, the only person who ever brought happiness to me and lit up my life with her positivity and energy. I have tried to change, sought professional help, and reached out a few times to apologise and see if I can make amends to try and fix things, but it looks like I have done too much to be forgiven. Everyday since then I have just been an empty she will, either crying or just sitting there lost and desperately hoping she will reach to give me a sign things will be ok. But as each day passes I am losing hope, and with it a piece of me, I can feel myself losing more of my soul each day, it is been crushed beyond repair over this. As I said, I have been thorugh some really low and dark points before, but this feels different to all of them, beyond anything I have ever felt. It does not just feel like this is worse that those moments, it feels like it is the end. I know I am not going to be strong enough to cope with this as time goes on. it is like I am just waiting for the end now, I know that one day this depression and pain over this is going to eventually overcome me, and when that day comes I know I will give in and allow it to end me. it is like I am just on borrowed time, stalling as best I can. I know it will not be today, it will not be tomorrow, but I know eventually the day will come when it is just too much. I have even started writing messages and letters for when I finally go, and have started to clear out my house to the bare minimum so it will be easy for whoever has to clear it out after I am gone. Sorry, this is probably more of a vent that anything as I am beyond help now. I have done all I can to try and save things but I have failed to earn her forgiveness. Really I am already dead, the day I lost her friendship is the day I died, I am just now waiting around knowing that one day finally my body will follow. Feeling like my depression has finally overcome me, and that it is just inevitable that oneday it will finally become too much.",1
"Stressing a little of medication side effect Hi! I've been having issues with constantly feeling like I need to pee and not emptying my bladder for a few months now (although all medical tests have indicated there's nothing (at least structurally) wrong). I am a male. I was prescribed 0.4 mg Tamsulosin HCl (aka Flomax), which relaxes the muscles in the pelvic area, and muscle tension and anxiety are suspected to be the cause. I read through the booklet I got with the medicine and I just have concerns about the fact that one of the side effects is retrograde ejaculation (where semen enters the bladder instead of leaving the body...sorry for putting that image in everyone's heads). It itself is not a serious symptom, and I know even if it does happen, it will go away when I stop taking the medicine. I'm only taking it short term, too. I guess basically does anyone else also get stressed out about side effects? Any mental tips on how to stop being so crazy about it? Of course I know rationally that my doctor decided the benefit much outweighs potential risks, and that they always put every possible side effect because that's just legalese and what not. It's ridiculous because I know this medicine was given to me to HELP me! But this crazy irrational side of me can't just relax and take it.. ",2
"Pain and consciousness/attention I haven't talked to a doctor about this because I hardly know how to describe it. Just wondering if anyone knows what I'm talking about.

Sometimes when I get a sudden, brief twinge of pain, it feels like my consciousness shifts. Not like I'm dizzy or faint or anything, but sort of like my train of thought just stops and my attention is immediately focused. It's almost a ""woosh"" feeling. It doesn't happen every time I feel pain, just sometimes.

Is this normal? Weird? Maybe related to blood pressure? I have no idea.",2
"What's wrong with me? (INSECURITIES) I (27M) had a horrible breakup 4 years ago and since then I've dealt with depression, suicidal thoughts, and very low self-esteem. I've been seeing progress in my mental state and I'd say I'm doing much better than the years since and have better coping mechanisms for my negative thoughts.

  
However, there are some insecurities that are still with me. I've just met someone wonderful about 4 years younger than myself but I can't seem to properly love/trust/feel secure with this person. When she talks about traveling with her friends, I get turned off. It's like I only want her with me. I feel a sense of abandonment. Also, I don't have any close friends like hers or I don't think I do. My ex called me a loner when we broke up and that's stuck with me.  
When this new girl talks of her successes I feel like shit again and get turned off. I want to be the Alpha, I want to be successful and take care of her. I get attracted to broken people , maybe because I'm broken. I don't know if it's fair to her if I continue this relationship. I want a relationship but it seems that I'm not ready. I want a bestfriend.

I know it was a very bad decision but I was helpless and I do not know what to do now. I need to pass this time and I am unable to think of coordinate properly. Everything feels stumbled. I had to make myself not think about how I should knowingly fail and that would give me a reason to kill myself. Every single day I had to grind myself to suppress these thoughts. I am tired and do not want to fail again now. I am only hurting my parents and burdening them. I have an exam tomorrow.",1
"Man, when I thought these months were going good, nope it was preparing me for this 2 weeks before I felt on top of the world, nothing could stop me. I was getting over my health anxiety and was ready. I was also about to score a new job and leave this cruddy one. It was all going good, until the next week. I found out that the job I was taking was a total scam. Fine, time to just wait it out and try some online freelancing (fyi first time). Oh look a job opportunity! Nope two more scams that further irritated me (fun). Fine, I guess I will try to hang out with some fiends. I call a few people and text (no response for days). Now I am starting to feel the partial feeling of depression. Next thing I know, my school work began to pile up and was now behind (awesome!) But the funny thing is, the week ended okay for me that is until Sunday. Without any explanation whatsoever, my ex(who hated my guts after I broke up with her but I was cool with) dmed me months after our last talk. Ok, I am not upset or angry at her, she changed alot and is happy with her new bf (something I was hoping she would get) but this was the match to light the fuel. After taking to her, I began to see how much good stuff she is gone through the years and I (should not have done this) mistakenly started comparing her life to mine. that is where I took a total fall. I immediately blocked her because I was jeleous of her new life(mind you I wished for her happiness) because I was so insecure at the time. Luckily she dmed me in a unblocked account and that is how I found out i was not inheritly mad at her. Now I am just at the bottom of my life. I feel burnt out and just lost a good deal of hope. I am so tired of having straight up bad luck I want good things to happen (I also feel karma may have something to do with this)I am just done. The worst depressive wave this year",1
"Lymph node just...gone? 21M, I’ve been worried about lymphoma for over a year now. I had a lump in my armpit that I didn’t know if it was a lymph node/cyst/muscle/nothing at all for over a year. It never grew, changed, anything. I check it from time to time and get anxious once in a while, but have gotten it relatively under control (the anxiety). 

Anyways, I go to the gym today like any other normal day, come home to shower and it’s....not there? I cracked my shoulder at the gym but nothing else out of the ordinary (I did work shoulders) and it’s just not sticking out like it did, and I’m thoroughly confused and quite honestly anxious for no reason at all. I have been dealing with a shoulder injury for as long as I can remember as well. 

Where did it go? Was it not a lymph node then? It’s still the slightest bit asymmetrical from my right armpit, but not like usual. Was it likely not even a lymph node then? 

I’ve been told that if it remained unchanged for so long (14 months from noticing it) that it’s either unlikely a lymph node or just a shotty one. It’s rare that lymphoma would leave the same node unchanged for such a long time I was told. ",2

"it is night, and I am crying again for no reason. Fuck, I wish the numbness would come back. I have I need something to do, but I cannot stop crying. it is all silent too because I do not want any damned speech about how this is all my fault and that I should have expected this. I know all that shit already. it is practically a worn trench in my mind at this point. All that does is push me more to become an alcoholic, an inevitability at this point.And if it is not the little condescending spats, it is the pointed accusiations or laughs at me being a damned crybaby. it is like that with every emotion, tears or smiles or whatnot.Please, I just want that emptiness back.

I have been on sertraline for about a month now. I took 25 mg for the first two weeks and now I am on 50 mg. I have a psychiatrist appt later to maybe update my dosage to 100 mg. I am not on any antipsychotics atm but my psychiatrist has mentioned wanting to put me on olanzapine for quite a while now and I think hes going to bring it up now that the antidepressants ordeal is mostly settled. I am very scared. I have never taken an antipsychotic before. I have done some research myself and I found that it increases the risk of irregular heart rhythm and this is just terrible really because I already suffer from irregular heart rhythm due to anorexia. I would really appreciate it if anyone who has taken this combination can share their experience and maybe provide some reassurance Has anyone here taken olanzapine and sertraline together?,1
"I have been told many times to ""stop being negative"" and learn to ""love myself."" I do not, because I hate so much about myself and it is nothing I can change. I hate how I look, I am non-binary and am disgusted at my physical form. I hate the family I was born into and they have made me into the fucked up person I am today and I am in a situation where I am stuck with them. (I am disabled from physical and mental health, but I do not trust and am paranoid about doctors, hospitals, therapists and what interacts/experience I have had was all bad and my parents cannot move. I am socially anxious and terrified of the outdoors so I just live in my room at my parents house. I was homeschooled and we live in a small town so I have no friends IRL.) I am attracted to women, but I am unattractive and boring looking and have a kind of boring personality. My mental state has been royally fucked to the point I have lost most care in the world. I have no energy, I am tired all of the time, easily get frustrated/angry, I am a coward, I am paranoid, and I am useless and worthless... I have suffered from depression and suicidal thoughts since I was a teenager (I am 33). I have a lot of differing opinions about the world, society, life, people that I know most of the world would not agree and think I am crazy or fucked up. I also have fucked up thoughts that would freak the hell out of people. I am too different and everything I have had to suffer in my life...the damage is done.I wish things could be different. There were periods in my time I had hope or I tried, but it always failed. I am a human like everyone else, with similar desires, but not everyone gets what they want or even need. Not everyone gets help, not everyone gets cured, not everyone gets saved. it is called life, it sucks, I hate it, but I have come to a place of acceptance. I will be alone, I will be isolated, I will have to rely on distraction from getting through this miserable life. Thankfully, I have a vast imagination and since I was a kid I have lived in my head. In my imagined world I can be who I want, look how I want, have what I want, achieve what I would like, be with who I want...But occasionally I have moments where depression really fucks with me. Voices in my head reminds me how fucked up my life is, how alone I really am, how I will never have what I see and hear what others get and so easily because their life turned out better and they had a better chance at gaining a life. The world in my head is so much better then reality and I wish it was real, for my sake and the sake of so many others who can relate somewhat. Life Made Me What I Am (Venting)",1

"Enema side effects? 30. F. Australia.

I was administered a fleet enema at the hospital last night (18hrs ago to be exact) for painful constipation. I wasn't completely impacted as I could still pass gas and small stools. 

I am having really bad abdominal pain and cramping today. It's freaking me out. I have had paracetamol, buscopan and simethicone but the pain is probably still a 7 out of 10. I've had two fleet enemas before and definitely experienced *some* cramping the next day but not as bad as this. Is this normal? I understand my muscles are sore from pushing out the stool (and there was a fair bit of it). 

No other symptoms besides the cramping and pain.",2

"To make a better picture of my situation: I am a 20-year-old man. I live on my own since my 18th birthday. have not finished a real education. At the moment I am starting my second Gap Year. I just do not know what or who to be.I just really do not know what to do with my life at the moment. Like in the past I was really an extrovert. No problem at all with communicating with people and I was just really happy. I got diagnosed with psychosis 3 years ago. I was even admitted for the psychosis for 3 weeks. After this, I had 2 years of therapy and it really went well with me eventually. I made a really nice new friend group. Picked up school again. I just got happy again and tried to pick up my life again. Then happened Covid19. Since covid started it just went downhill again. I started a gap year. Because I live on my own I work full time so I can pay my rents etc. My job was working in a call center as customer service for a company with a webshop.Because of covid19, everything closed, and what my normal week looked like is as followed. At the beginning of covid19, I had still lots of contact with my friend group. Of course a lot less than years before because I was working full time. Also because of my job I got in contact with so many people that like my social battery eventually drained out. How further they year went how lesser the contact became I had with other people. Not even my friend group. Because this friend group smoked weed I also started with weed. In the last year is just got addicted to it what just makes the situation for me even harder to solve. It just became so difficult for me to make contact with other people or maintain it. It also requires a lot of energy for me to have contact with people face2face. Like with my job on the phone it is not a problem. But just when I am face2face I just do not know how to react or what to say. When I get home I just do not have any energy to do anything other than just game or sit behind my pc.Compared to how I was I just do not recognize myself anymore. I do not know who I am. To be honest. I just really do not know how I can get to know myself again. It just really looks like I transformed from an extrovert to an Introvert. Can anybody by any chance relate to this in any way? Does anybody have any tips or advice on what helped you to get yourself to know yourself again?PS. I am sorry for any grammar mistakes. My first language is not English. hope my writing makes some sense. Can you go from an extrovert to an Introvert?",1

"Everything in life is great except my stressful line of work making me feel like it’s better to just end it I (20s/F) have everything I could possibly want. I have a house in a nice area, an amazing fiancé that I can’t wait to start a family with, a well paying job… but I feel like I’ve been going insane. 

I’m sleep deprived, can’t take care of myself, can’t be there for my family, fiancé, take care of my house, still wish my fiancé would’ve wanted to elope because I have hated wedding planning cause of my stress and anxiety, and just feel like I’m failing no matter how hard I try. 

I’ve been in this line of work for a few years now, and I have awful anxiety about it, and sometimes it just feels like nothing is worth it …and now that I even have the things I wanted in life, I still don’t want to be here. 

I dual majored in engineering and have worked in the auto industry since I was 18. Due to graduating right when covid hit, I lost all my interview for dream positions, and somehow ended up in supervisor/operations roles at plants. I am extremely thankful for the experience I’ve gotten (I genuinely believe I can do anything after this) and now am doing it with the company I wanted to work for and am on a good shift now instead of night shift. I work my butt off, always have… cause I feel like I’m this industry if I’m not the best I’ll be considered the “bimbo female hire”. I have a lot of support from higher ups and constantly get told I’ll be able to move onto a more technical role outside of the plants sooner than late so it feels like there’s a light at the end of the tunnel. However, some days it feels like it’s never going to end… 60+ hour weeks, constant overtime, you receive crap from hourly and the salary above you, pretty hostile work environment, the building should be condemned how nasty and unsanitary it is… you name it. Half the stuff that’s said or done would be HR fireable offenses at the offices. You just become just as crappy if you’re there long enough too. I have constant breakdowns and then feel guilty for feeling that way. I just feel hopeless. Seeing my coworkers getting stuck/held back is adding major fuel to the fire as well. 

Sorry about how ranty this is. Can’t really get my thoughts straight.",3

On may way I thought the grief and shame would be unfair to my family. I reached for help instead. I faced hospitalization, was demoted at my job, countless conversations reliving my experience, countless medications that did nothing, ECT treatments, ketamine treatments, talk therapy and nothing helps. Now I feel the worst I have since my crisis. Still suicidal with a plans. However the 1 million questions game teaches to not share a lot of your plans details. They will just share it with your family thus making them suffer. I have really tried for the sake of my family but I am exhausted. Even the smallest amount of stress triggers me.

The truth is I am insanely depressed and suffer from anxiety disorders and panic attacks. On top of that I have paranoid thoughts as well as suicidal thoughts.

I have felt that way all my life. I have never really told anyone.I am embarrassed, so I have never talked about it openly. But I cannot anymore. I feel an infinite depth inside me that I have never been able to fill and continue to not be able to. Something is pulling me into the dark.

"I am a drug abuser (benzos and meth mostly) and have been diagnosed with schizophrenia 11 years ago. My psychosis is getting worse although my drug use is ceasing. I dissociate heavily and I barely even feel like I am a real person typing this. The voices and visual hallucinations are constant, but worst at night when I am alone and not doing anything. My best friend barely talks to me anymore and its killing me to think that I care more about her than she does about me. Worth mentioning I am kind of in love with her. She was the best at calming me down in severe episodes of psychosis and was always so patient and caring and gentle. And now that I do not have her in my life anymore, its tempting me to use drugs to cope with the depression which I know will make the schizophrenia worse so its a lose/lose. Every night now I lay in bed and listen to the voices telling me awful things about myself, usually in the voices of people I know, worst of all, in the voice of my dad who passed away 4 years ago that I never grieved over because I was so out of it on drugs. I feel so alone and I get so scared at night because I have been known to dissociate and black out and harm myself, coming inches from killing myself, literally (I had a gun pointed at my temple and the trigger was being slightly pulled, came to just before the bang). I constantly struggle with the decision of whether I want to live the rest of my life trying to deal with this horrible disorder, or if I want to just say game over and call it quits. I do not really have a point to this, I just needed to rant. I need help",1

"I'm going to try not to sound too sad or victimized, but I'm just sad. I grew up fairly disadvantaged compared to my friends. I've been poor since I was born, never had enough to eat, was abused by my dad, have raised my sister, support my family, work almost constantly, and make money on the side. In addition, I've been consistently abused since I was 8 years old, the same age I met my best friend. She's much wealthier than I am.",0
"Am I depressed and if yes why? Hello, 

I am male and twenty years old and actually I have a great life: I have great parents and a brother, I was successful in sports until my injury and I finished school very successfully a few years ago. In the meantime I have also almost finished the first part of my studies and I am successful there as well. In addition, I have a great - albeit small but fine - group of friends.

Somehow I have been feeling weak and tired for some time now and can't really motivate myself to do anything. I think a lot, especially about the past.

My school days were difficult at the beginning because I was bullied. I am almost highly gifted and always had difficulties to get into a really casual conversation with other people. Also, I had different interests than kids my age. After I changed schools, the situation was immediately better and I had made real friends for the first time and also developed self-worth. I just went through with school and left all the dating stuff alone, following the motto ""Will come around then, I have time"".

At the same time, it was always difficult in my family, too. My depressed and schizophrenic grandmother hates my parents, even though she lives next door to them. The whole thing goes so far that she says things like she would rather be dead than live next to people like my parents. 

Because I moved out to study, I was able to escape this somewhat, but it still depresses me because I am her only confidant.

Some time ago I tried dating and was only disappointed and hurt. I had not thought that rejection offends me so much. However, I have always been able to pick myself up again after recovery periods and continue. Then, about two and a half months ago, I met a girl - completely unexpectedly and unfortunately online - who completely enchanted me. And vice versa as well. She doesn't live quite nearby, but I have no problem with having to drive and it's not so far that we can't see each other every weekend. We then had together after a few meetings also our respective first kisses and now just look where the journey goes....

This feeling that I can actually be attractive and appealing is indescribable to me. And I have noticed how much I have always missed physical closeness the last few years, although I NEVER wanted to admit it and have always denied. 

The whole thing triggers a total existential crisis for me and throws me off track: Everything I have lived for the last few years now seems useless and disgusts me. I read my resume and am disgusted by the stringing together of courses, successes and professional experiences. I feel bad because for the last few years I've always laughed at couples for not getting the rest of their lives together. I feel bad because I've always tied my self-worth to achievement and now I see and feel that that's not actually what it's worth living for. But that it is love that one should live for.

Am I depressed and do I need professional help? My problem is that as a future civil servant I could then have problems with the medical officer and then no civil service relationship could come about. Do you have similar experiences or tips on how I should best deal with this?",1

"I got the big sad but I prefer it that way I (24) m for the past 10 years have been pretty depressed since I grew up moving home to home among my relatives constantly being around drugs and alcohol. Since I move around a lot I can't get a real attachment to anyone which is sad for me with the exception is my GF of 7 soon to be 8 years. But I lately I've begun to realize that I feel more comfortable being a depressed guy than happy, it's more like I rather be sad and tired so others can be happy. For example my gf's family have taken me in as their own even giving me the nickname ""Mikwap"" (mee-gwap) which roughly translated to home in our language. 

Anyways, I wouldn't say no to them when they asked something of me. Nothing too crazy, simple things like small chores that theirs children refuse to do, lend them money when they need, or drive 4+ hours for an event. There are more things. But I do stuff like this for my actual family too and it's making me feel drained mentally and physically which leeds to my depression. I don't have a lot of time to myself and I struggled with nearly becoming an alcoholic. I sacrifice myself like this because I want to see everyone smile and be comfortable especially the children in both families. I don't want them to have a hard life moving around or being around drugs and alcohol. Lately my gf has been telling me not to worry about everyone so much and take time to myself. I considered it but I'm worried something will happen if I'm not around to help. 

I'm at work right now while I type this. And would like some outside opinions. 

Also I'm sorry about the title, I just use small amounts of humors to hide my depression",1
"Need Support ASAP for rabies fear!! So on January 4th (almost 2 weeks ago) I pet, and gently moved, a friendly cat out of the road by a local restaurant. He let me pick him up under one arm in my fluffy winter coat without too much resistance or fighting back, but darted off a little peturbed once I moved him. He may have lightly dug his claws in for balance and surprise at being moved- but as a germaphobe who is very afraid of cat scratch fever, I feel I would've noticed excessive claws making it through my winter layers.

I went about my night (my birthday night) without much else of a thought for the cat. The next morning I did discover a fair amount of dried bleeding and cut/scraped area on my elbow that I'm still not sure how it came to be. But again, I patched it up and went about my days. Its since healed fine. I wasn't intoxicated, but I had been out dancing late and thought maybe I bumped it at some point.

Fast forward to today, January 17th, and the talk of rabies comes up. Suddenly I remember the cat and mysterious scratch. Surely I would've known if the cat did It? He was friendly, docile, and clean. I figured he belonged to some one living in the city located nearby to the place we were eating at since he was chubby and had a soft clean coat. But now I'm freaked out! Should I talk to my Dr about getting a rabies shot now?! Its been 2 weeks on Saturday.

**I fully intend to call my Dr in the morning and have spoken to the nurse hotline. I just know they also kind of have to give me the ""just in case"" response and would like some more candid input**

"My mind &amp; body choses flight instead of fight.  I (26F), am going through it tonight. Honestly? I couldn't tell if my post belonged in the anxiety or rant subreddit, but I asked myself aloud, ""How do I feel?"", and my answer was: stressed.

So, here I am. 

Crying and bawling my eyes out. 'Why?' you might ask. Well, I'll tell you a little bit about me...I am an overweight female who has gone through shit in my 26 years of living. My childhood was basically robbed of me, mainly because I witnessed fights and screaming matches between family members and a near divorce with the parentals. I was also bullied majority of my early childhood all the way through middle school. After all of this happened (and there was a lot more than that), I felt like I was forced to grow up and basically chose 'flight mode' to save myself.

What I mean by that is, closing myself off. Staying in my room and coming out when I absolutely have to. I have a fear of being rejected, and being a failure. I am afraid of being yelled at for doing something wrong and I have a fear of getting into trouble and being reprimanded.

I still live with my parents and I have no job because of just basically, being socially anxious. I stutter around people I don't know and that makes me even more anxious and self-conscious. I forget things easily and that in turn, furthers my fear of being incapable of a job. On top of that, I have trouble sleeping at night because thoughts run through my head a million times a second. Because of this, I wake up late almost everyday (at 11am).

Just tonight, my mom basically dumped a, 'we need to talk' case on me and already I felt my blood run cold. She's talking to me but all I hear is my heart thumping in my ears. She tells me I need to work on waking up early because the rest of the world wakes up early like ""adults"". I felt very offended by that and told her that it's not my fault that I can't sleep properly at night. I, in fact, tell this to her everyday, so it's not old news. Yet, when I did remind her of this, she basically sighed and almost wanted to roll her eyes. Then she tells me I need a week to just 'work on myself' to fix that and realistically, thats not how that works but I didn't say anything.

Then she tells me I need to find a job. Something that pays and that 70% of the world gets up and does a 9 to 5 job which I already knew. Now, I was starting think she thinks I'm lazy or something when it's absolutely not the case.

Truth is, I have been getting together with my younger sister who is an artist on doing freelance stuff that we are both interested in doing. We have been talking about it little by little. I told my mom this and she didn't seem to believe me, basically looking at me with an expression of, ""Ohhh really like what"".

So she asks, ""Okay, what have y'all worked on today?"" of all things she asks on the day me and my younger sister decide to take at least the day off from planning. I said, ""Well, we are taking a break today but I designed some stuff for xx and sended it to her and she reformatted and polished it up."" my mom seemed to deflate in a way that said, 'That was it?' 

Not gonna lie, it made me feel bad and then she went into a repeated 5 minute lecture on how we need to wake up earlier and start the day like adults. Meanwhile I'm here depressed, stressed and just over it at this point. Over the fact that she just doesn't understand at all. She says, 'I know you can do it. I know that.'

But does she really? Anytime I do, 'do it', she seemes to be unsatisfied and that pushes me a million steps back. 

I get upset and after we finish talking, I go to my room to sleep (11pm at this point) and I just start bawling at how useless I felt and the whole, 'why is my life like this'.

It took so much in me not to burst into tears in front of her but man my throat was tighrening so bad it hurt that I couldn't speak for a good few seconds.

I don't know, I guess I just need some advice on the situation? Anytime I'm in this position my stress literally goes through the roof and I don't know how to manage it (like the need to runaway, disappear or worse). I really do want to work, I want to recieve a paycheck and get my own place and my own car and things, but why am I always on flight mode all the time?",3
"Feeling of trapped burp/excessive burping/Nausea Hello all, lately I’ve been going through a scare as someone with IBS. Lately I’ve been excessively burping. Even if I haven’t eaten anything yet, and especially once I eat something. However, the thing is sometimes I need to force the burp out because it feels like it’s trapped in my stomach or chest or throat. And when I’m unable to get the burp out, it makes me feel nauseous. For the past couple of days except yesterday, I’ve been either dry heaving or actually vomiting. When I vomit, it’s either this clear liquid that tastes like acid, which I assume is acid, and sometimes it’s food I eat. Burping helps relieve the feeling for a few minutes but then it’s back. This has been happening for a couple of weeks already. But before, I wasn’t diagnosed with IBS. I had HA about colon cancer. Once I was told that it was IBS by my GI, the burping never stopped but the nausea sort of did.

Fast forward a little bit, and I was fine. I was eating healthier and my bowel movements were even improving. I even went on a trip to Hawaii and I was fine there. I had one bout of nausea but that’s it. And then shit hit the fan right when I got back from Hawaii. Basically whatever I said in the beginning lol. But here’s a list of all my symptoms/medical issues:

-Excessive burping
-feeling like a burp is trapped in stomach/chest/throat
-Nausea (due to reason above)
-Occasional acid when I burp and in the morning when I wake up (making me think it’s possibly GERD but I don’t have heartburn and this feeling is only occasional)
-dry heaving/vomiting clear liquid/food. No red blood or coffee grounds or green or yellow liquid.
-mild IBS, no abdominal pain, predominantly constipation (although it has been getting better. I’ve been having nice BM every day. But yesterday it was diarrhea which is weird)
-sometimes blood on the toilet paper, but this always happens when I have to strain and it hurts and itches. GI says I have internal hemorrhoids.
-BM are usually 4-5 on the Bristol stool chart
-Swollen turbinate and a deviated septum (ah my first bout of my HA. If I could go back in time I would prevent this lol).
-Fatigue
-some skin patches that idk if it’s eczema or psoriasis. Leaning towards eczema since I have an intense family history of it.

I’ve had no weight loss, thankfully. I actually gained weight in Hawaii haha. So it’s basically the burping, nausea that is making my HA spike. And it sucks because it makes me anxious that I have some deadly colon/stomach disease again, and I’ve considered making an appointment with my GI to see if I can get an endoscopy/colonoscopy, which he was very reluctant to do since I’m 22 years old. This burping and nausea is just so annoying and depressing. I had to go home from work because of it. I’ve been combating the vomiting well so far. Breathing sort of helps with nausea, as well as chewing gum and ginger ale. However, they haven’t been as effective as before. My mind is going through so many possibilities of what this could be: hiatal hernia, GERD, postnasal drip from my nose problems, a general IBS flare up, a stomach ulcer, my stupid anxiety, or something worse. It’s just so fucking scary. The only thing that makes me feel better is sleep. Please, the best advice and/or reassurance.

"Chest pain insomnia ugh All day I was experiencing intermittent chest pain near my heart. Knowing I have anxiety, I always try my best to give random aches and pains a chance to subside but it gets really hard at night. Now I keep waking up and feeling it, and worse, now I feel this weakness like my blood sugar or blood pressure is off. I just had a regular wellness exam about a month or so ago and my blood pressure is always low so I know it's ridiculous to think I suddenly have some kind of heart disease but oh my god I can't sleep for more than 30 minutes at a time and its killing me! Unfortunately I just moved recently and I absolutely hated the doctor I saw at my union's preferred primary care provider, and they are closed on weekends anyways. So I'm pretty much just stuck stressing and worrying. Please let this go away tomorrow!

"I think I have come to terms that is I am not really balanced when it comes to myMental health. there is a lot of issues, and to put it lightly it really fucking sucks when you found a person that is keeps you grounded and levelled, and they depart your life. Its like your life is a giant hole, and you spend years climbing your way out, falling all the way back down at points. Then someone comes along and grabs your hand, helping you and pulling you up along the way, only for them to slowly start losing grip over time. No matter how much you try to get them to strengthen that grip and no matter how much they assure it they will, they decide to randomly let go. You fall all the way to the bottom and it feels like your forced to just sit there staring up at them everyday. You get to see their life play out while you are stuck at the bottom of a fucking pit. Not knowing if someone else will ever come along , and no amount of cigarettes, alcohol, or pills will help you climb back up. They just help to make their visage at the top a little more blurry. No matter how many of your loved ones offer their hands you refuse, and you dig the hole deeper because you do not want to hurt them like you have been hurt. So that is where I am, at the bottom of this pit that I keep digging deeper, for who knows what reasons. Every time e I try to start the climb out I make progress for a little while and then decide to let go. I wrote up how I have been feeling",1

This is all 1 days worth of stuff and it’s not even everything but this has been going on for months.

Also I can’t sleep I’m getting 5 hours ish a night and I used to get 8 hours everyday. I don’t know what to do whether I’m justified going to a doctor or I’m just being stupid and making people with real anxiety and other mental illness look bad I feel like I’m being stupid and I hate my personality.

"Back in this stupid lonely hole with no one to share my thoughts with Sorry In advanced for the rant of anyone even reads this lol, 19m, I used to use this app a lot to talk people out of hurting themselves or give people a chance to vent when I was really depressed as a coping mechanism I guess. I started feeling better as I graduated high school with honors and began moving towards an exciting and new time in my life. There were ups and downs sure, but I was probably happier than I’ve been in years since entering college. I found new hobbies, met amazing friends, worked out, etc, I even finished the semester with all As. That’s why it hurts even more to still be in this place. Nearly all of my online friends ditched me like they always do, half of my real life friends just stopped showing any interest In me, I can’t find a reason to give af about school and I’ve stopped all but one of my hobbies (piano). It’s like once I get a taste of feeling okay everything falls apart and I know what I need to do to fix it, but I just feel so alone and I need so badly to share my thoughts with someone but despite being in a school of ten thousand plus people, there’s not one person I feel okay turning to for help. I just want it to end, it never gets better and it hurts so much because I have a lot of love for other people and I just never seem to have that love reciprocated. I never leave anyone, but people always get bored of me and move on to the next. I just want someone to love me man",1

"Irrational fear of rabies So I know that my fear is irrational but I can’t stop thinking about it! 

At the beginning of January (I mean very beginning like 4th) I was at a store where the owner had two cats. The cat that bit was very friendly at first, was rubbing against my mom and I. My mom had playfully ruffled its head and it had swatted at her, I then went to pet it and it bit me! Looking back it the incident I know the cat was most likely just annoyed hence why it bit me. 

At the end of January I (mistakenly) decided to consult dr google about rabies. This seemed to set something off in my brain, that night I couldn’t sleep. I was terrified that I was going to die of rabies. I went to the doctors and received a tetanus shot and was told to call the owner. 

My mom called for me and the owner told her that since the cats are in a public place they have to be up to date on their shots. While this was reassuring at first, a day later I kept having what if’ thoughts. Such as “what if the lady was lying about about the cat being vaccinated”

Either way it’s now March and I’m experiencing what I think is anxiety. Every time I think about my health, my chest tightens up and it feels like I can’t breath. I’m having awful muscle twitches in my legs, arms, and eyelids. I’m also having what I think is “pains” in my left arm (not the arm I was bit by the cat).  And the newest thing is I’m getting horrible nausea to the point where I feel close to throwing up (and I haven’t thrown up in years). Even now I can’t help but wonder “what if I’m just having a long term incubation period”

I guess I’m here looking for some reassurance that I’m not going crazy or dying slowly of rabies",2

"I never thought I would have to grieve the loss of a teacher, and I am having a lot of painful regrets for being a bit of a tough student to teach. I was not as close to her as my peers but I tried to be. I was not quite sure if she liked me and sometimes she made me mad. She was really strict with me and I never understood anything in her class because it was so advanced, but now that she is gone I am severely grieving and completely heartbroken. I am afraid it might send me back into the depression I just crawled out of. Anything helps. My teacher died",1
Never got to get a chance I recently ended a relationship and I’ve been back on the tinder and matched with a guy I was interested in we had a date planned but weather ruined our plans so we rescheduled but had to move the date again as he was busy finally message him after like 4 days off the face of the earth and arranged a new date which was for tomorrow I was excited to finally meet this guy so I message him today to make sure plans are still good and he tells me he got a girlfriend it happened last night so now I’m just upset I also am seeing someone else but I’m still bummed I never got the chance I’ll still be able to meet him as friends but not what I wanted lol I just wanted to vent feel free to laugh at me 🤣,1

i can t do this anymore i genuinely can t it s gotten to the point where everything is too difficult and i want to quit i have severe panic attack when i can t cut deep enough i just relapsed and it wasn t even worth it the cut weren t deep enough it doesn t even matter i don t want to be here anymore it s just an endless cycle of nonstop difficulty every night it s the same thing the day seem to blend together what doe it matter anymore if i m here the world will still turn i ve never made that much of a difference who would even care i m exhausted please let me rest,1
"Constantly held back by not feeling worthy of getting better. I've been depressed for a few years now. I don't feel totally lost. Somewhere inside me, I still have hope, I still have a real belief that it's possible for me to feel normal and happy again. But there's a much stronger feeling, an overwhelmingly powerful one, that even if I *could* be happy again, I don't deserve it. I don't deserve support from others, I don't deserve to make small gains for myself. Every time I start to move in a positive direction, every time others give me advice and offer help, every time it seems like I'm finally digging myself out of the hole.... I stop myself. I hurt myself. I don't let myself get better, because I feel like I don't deserve to be better. 

I hate it. It feels totally inescapable. No matter what progress or advantage I'm giving, I end up deliberately damaging it and tossing it away, because I can't escape the feeling that I deserve nothing but suffering, that it's an injustice to the world if I get better.

Does anyone else feel this way? Is there any way to feel worthy?",1

I also have been dealing with tmj like symptoms (head pressure,stiff neck issues, minor back issues, ear ringing) I’m just afraid something is wrong no matter how many times people say it’s anxiety.

"I hate my anxiety I'm saying it with all the bottom of my soul.

I hate the person my anxiety has turned me into, I can't run (I loved to run), I can't leave my house without having a freaking panic attack, I can't go to the store without carrying my freaking backpack full of things that I have to have it in case I have a fucking panic attack, I can't watch the damn TV without some damn intrusive thought coming through, I can't go to the damn store because I think I'm going to have a heart attack,i won't let me help my mom get her medicine or help my sister run the supermarket because I keep thinking that something bad is going to happen when I leave the house.

Yesterday I was feeling depressed, in fact I even thought about taking my life, but that's when a deep hatred came to me, it started as a little anger and now it has turned into an uncontrollable anger to kick something, I thought ""damn anxiety is getting me making me want to kill myself"" 

Good grief, I don't hate life, I love living, I want to live, I want to write a fucking book, I want to buy a decent computer, I'm having a panic attack that's pretty much subsided because right now I hate my anxiety.",2
"Health anxiety / Zoloft side effects? I went off anxiety medication 8 months ago. Cut it cold turkey by accident (I was never told otherwise). Thankfully had no withdrawals or anything. I have severe, severe, severe health anxiety and I was doing really good up until a few months ago it started to get bad again- but I was managing. However, the past 2 weeks have been really really hard with my health anxiety and I knew I needed to finally get back on and I’m so happy to be back on. I had some stomach issues and I’m freaking out. I had blood in my stools and bad pains in my pelvis. I also for the past 2 months have had a dull ache in my upper left abdomen. Had some blood and stool tests and all was good. Today is day 2 is taking my medication (Zoloft) and I have a weird, nauseating feeling in my throat/chest. It feels exactly like when you get super giddy and your chest/throat squeals with excitement. But I don’t feel excited- I feel so anxious. It’s almost like I have to gag or dry heave. Can the Zoloft be causing this? I had no side effects last time I was on it so it’s weird. My anxiety is going crazy because I’m afraid it has to do with my other symptoms.",2
"I can't trust myself I have self DX-ed hypochondria, I've known I've had it for 4 years now.. The thing I struggle with the most is never being able to trust how I'm feeling.

I feel like I'm going crazy, my family isnt supportive at all, a lot of the time I just need reassurence that I'll be okay, and yet all I get is sarcasm and jokes at my expense.

"A small victory I don't post very often and never before on this sub but I wanted to share a small victory.  As you can imagine I spend a lot of money on doctor visits and tests that turn out to be just fine. I have spent too darn much and so I've challenged myself to just wait things out no matter what. My first challenge arrived quickly.  

On Tuesday I got a rash very likely from sweating/rubbing because I noticed it right after the gym and it was around my neck and chest where my shirt collar rests. It was red, itchy and painful.  I DID NOT Google.  I started to,  but I stopped.  I put some hydrocortisone cream on it and ignored it. Ever so briefly thought about going to urgent care (autoimmune? My joints hurt... is it infected? Etc.) 

It's almost gone today. Four days. Granted the source of the rash was clear. And I'm still worried about the size of the lymph nodes in my neck. And random belly pains make me think of tumors.... but this one thing..... I waited out this rash and it was fine. It gives me strength to ""ignore"" the next thing.",2

"I am a bubble floating through a vast empty void. I do not know what to do. I wake up every day and do the exact same thing. I feel a heavy force pulling me deeper into my home. The anxiety I feel over thoughts of leaving my fortress gives me physical pain. I have no purpose to move in any direction except back and forth. I sometimes feel that I am losing grip on reality. I feel consumed by the screens in front of me. Dependent on them for warmth. I write to myself every day, just like this. Today I decided to allow the public to digest my psyche. Perhaps to give me a better understanding of myself through unbiased eyes. I am gripped with fear. There is a xenomorph hammering my inner chest plate. Please do not judge me harshly. I am always alone. I should clarify; I have an elusive partner. My partner is an alcoholic drug user with a gambling addiction. They are also a hell of a go getter with a can do attitude. Observance prevents me from assimilation. Sex is a drug purchased with guilt. We have brief moments together where we exchange pleasantries before going about our days.They have a demanding job but are payed sufficiently well, all things considered. I do not have a job. I have had jobs. Too many jobs. I counted once. 22, I believe. My plethora of different career paths has been both a blessing and a curse. I am well read with a variety of skills. I feel consistently overlooked. I am average height. I feel my partner has resigned themselves to the inevitable descent into drinking alone at the video poker machines. We are both 32. My partner is well liked in the community. I am a shadow. I make the rare appearance at a function or two. I typically do not eat. My choice to eat or not to eat will be my martyrdom. I have not pinpointed why my body has become the offering. Although, I can provide a generous list of options. People seem to enjoy my company and compliment me on my looks and body. I am clean, well dressed, and have been told I have an intimidating presence. I hold a conservation well and have good comedic timing in the moment. My jokes are dry. Much to my dismay, I am not a large person. I am frail. I feel myself diminishing. My soul is drifting towards the event horizon. My partner and I played jeopardy once. The fight lasted for a week. I question my memories. When I speak of fortnight's passed, my words are taunted, belittled, questioned, or worst of all... Ignored. A victim chooses to be a victim. The poor choose to be poor. The path was paved for a different vehicle yet only I am to blame if I cannot pass. The fault is mine. My mind drifts through consciousness. Nicotine and constant vigilance vibrate through my sleepless body. My fears are desperate for attention. I exist only for brief entertainment when all else fails. I am the sideshow to a sideshow at a zoo. My only solace is found by translating thoughts into little notes that I leave for myself. Even now I question the weight of my words. My screams are yawns to the deaf. Wailing is no use when I am trapped in a bubble, floating through a void.Please advise. Please advise.",1

"No one to talk to So, I’m currently super stressed and I don’t feel like I have anyone to talk to. I’ve suffered with depression for a long time and I recently got a puppy. I’ve wanted another dog for about 10 years and I thought it was a good time to get one now since I’m WFH. The puppy is about 3 months old and at around 2 months, she started throwing up. I took her to the emergency vet and found out she had an obstruction in her intestines. This meant she had to have surgery and her insurance hasn’t kicked in so I had to pay out of pocket. I had to take out a credit card to pay the 7K bill. She came home and was doing really well. Then 2 days ago she started throwing up again. She threw up around 6 times. I took her back to the vet and they had to run a bunch of tests again (another 1K) and it seems like a treat I gave her may have irritated her intestines again. They wanted to do more tests but I literally can not afford it. I spoke to the vet about it as none of this can be covered by insurance. The vet gave her an anti nausea medication and sent us home to observe her. She ate and hasn’t vomited but I’m still nervous about it all. I really got the dog in hopes that it would also help with my depression but it’s becoming worse due to all of this…I feel helpless and I can’t afford to take her back to the vet…",3

"I was asked by a friend, ""why have you been so rude lately"" a few months ago. October 23, 2020. &amp;#x200B;At 12, midnight, I responded with, ""There really is not a straight answer to that question, If I told you, you would probably say I am faking it. I have this thing that feels like a disease, and it turns my positive switches off. It was not always like this though. I was nice, sometimes being too nice to the point I agree with everyone else's opinions no matter what it was. I thought when people were mean it meant they chose to be. But now that you ask I realize it might not be the only reason. I had little to no patience for anything. I lived in a constant state of anxiety and worry. When I engaged in conversation I felt like people found me annoying, and boring. I insulted them and a majority of the time gave them a passive-aggressive excuse for distancing myself from them. Thing is, I did not plan on being rude, it just happened. In the moment."" &amp;#x200B;Jesus Christ did not realize it was that long. Now that I am taking a good look at it I was right back then. I relate to that so much. Of course, I said it myself. I just thought I must have learned that from watching something, and applied it to myself because I related. But I tried to copy and paste it, but those are my words.I do not remember ever feeling so strongly. Maybe I blocked it out of my mind to distract myself. If so, good job me. It worked. But I found those messages again and it has me thinking.

"Iv been to therapy for so long that at this point my 5 year therapist just reminds me each session how much of a incomplete piece of shit Iam. Iv tried going to bars and clubs in hopes to learn how to socialize and got so many disgusting looks that it crushed my soul and caused a mental breakdown on my walk back home. So according to my therapist going to the bars and club is the final step. I was also told not to ask how do to get started improving myself because I should know where to start. So my brains just been a static mush there is so many questions with no answers. There are things that have to get started with no clear way to begin. All I could do I suffer in silence and beg the world to end my suffering soon. Every day I swear is like a new nightmare. I get to work with people who make alot of money and hear about their lives and what houses they are going to buy and make and trips they get to go to. Places I can never go since I do not make shit. it is like I am truly in hell always seeing people happy and enjoying life while I get rejected from it and get to see not touch. The people who hand out advice are the people who are already at the top. I have to scramble and work 1000% harder to experience 1% of what is given to them naturally. So I ask what is next? do not send the suicide hotline to me because I do not even have the guts, the will or the mental state to end myself because I am a fucking coward.

I have just became super antisocial and anxious after a break up in July (2020).Today one of them asked me how I was doing and I decided to reply after ignoring the message for a month. I told them that I was depressed and anxious as hell.

Couple months ago I would press hard on my ribs to feel if something hard that I felt is actually a rib or lymph node. I would spend hours rubbing ribs. It caused so much pain.

It's been 3 years since I started to worry about lymph nodes and what gives me a huge relief is a thought ""if it was something cancerous, I would for sure have more symptoms, which I dont"".

I was frantically looking for them and I asked my coworker if she saw them, she explained in a confusing manner that she already made snack. And if she made snack she would have been right in front of me because we were in a very small kitchen. And if I were ""there"" I definetly would have known.

so a couple month ago i finally had the courage to tell my girlfriend i wa cutting myself we ve since broken up but that doesn t matter too much she expressed her sympathy but then abruptly got up to go to the bathroom i wa concerned but she told me not to follow because this wa at school and i wouldn t be allowed so i trusted that her bladder just had terrible timing so i waited after a couple minute go by i start to get worried and that s when the teacher tell me that she found her cry in the bathroom and sent her to the counsellor office and i should go check on her i go to find her and she tell me that she had a panic attack because she ha trauma related to self harm i m obviously concerned for her but at the same time i m so angry she didn t even tell me anything wa wrong we talk for a bit and cry a lot but then the counsellor say they want to talk to her and i should get back to my class so i go back to class and i have to pretend that everything s ok that i haven t been experiencing the lowest point of my mental health ever and i have to go through it alone eventually she come back but only to grab her thing she tell me she s going home because she already had a bad morning and that it s not my fault all i wanted wa for someone to be there for me and the only person i could talk to just left i can t talk to counsellor because i m terrified of what would happen if my parent found out this happened month ago and i m still so angry at this i don t even talk to her anymore but i don t know how to deal with this,1

"TW: Brief mention of Abuse, Murder, and Self-harmIt's the anniversary of the day my nephew was born, and it is been a nearly a year since his death. I do not want to get too into it, but to give you some context, last year my sister had a placental abruption while pregnant which was caused by physical trauma inflicted by her husband to her stomach. My nephew was born with a brain bleed and severe brain damage, as well as other physical afflictions. Eventually, a month later, we had to let go of him, because there was just nothing the doctor's could do. This and a lot of other factors led to one of the worst spirals I have had in my life.Anyway, today, I thought everything was alright. I was going about my day, and I felt empty. But this is my usual state, so to me I was perfectly fine. So, I texted my sister to see how she was. It was alright the first couple of texts we sent back and forth, but then she mentioned the card box she had for writing cards every birthday for Adriel. She also mentioned ""Our little parasite"" which was something I wrote on mine. And I guess it was this specific detail caused all the memories of that horrible time to resurface, even though I thought I was fine. I sat and hyperventilated in my chair for about an hour after that. I feel like my depression is always prevalent, but at that time period for the months that followed his death were particularly bad. This event was not the only thing that caused me to go off the deep end, but I supposed you can call it the catalyst. I can feel the echoes of those feelings now, and I want to cut again so bad. I just want all of this to stop. Happy birthday, Adriel. I do not know if you are in a better place, because I am not sure if I believe that; but if there is a better place, I hope you are there. You did not deserve to have this happen to you. You deserved a long happy life, and I would have spoiled you rotten. I hope that the one that did this to you gets the justice he deserves. Rest in peace. Anniversary of My (Dead) Nephew's Birth",1

"Have severe depression. Had therapy friday and left feeling more hopeful, wanting to get better after a terrible week of being bedridden due to depression. Was even able to do dishes. But it all got ruined really fast. I told a friend I would not be able to play RPGs with him due to my condition, he was all offended and made it all about himself. I got negative feedback for my MA work and now I just feel worthless again. I know I should be happy I am still being able to study while feeling so horrible but it just makes me feel worse. I put all this effort into trying to keep my friends, my academic career, but I feel it is all for nothing. The desire to give up just gets stronger every day and I am getting worse. I lost so many people, family, friends, to COVID and even my dog died of cancer last year, I wish I still had something to cling onto but it all feels so pointless.I would be very thankful if anyone had some idea on how to let the negative things affect me less or just a word of sympathy. I do not know if it is the depression but everyone just seems so negative, like they just think I am lazy or taking too long to recover. I used to want to get better so much but now I just want to give up. Feel like my progress is worthless",1

All these years of youth wasted doing nothing. Tired of how competitive everything is, because I’m tired of fighting. Left behind by people who said they would always be there, until it wasn’t convenient anymore. Broke, ugly, tired and burnt out on this life. Maybe it could be worse, but that just makes me hate life more. Everyone acts like you have an obligation to this life. You’re obligated to get a job, make money, make a life for yourself. But I never asked for this life in the first place. I wish I could go back now, to that moment I was about to be born and press a button to cancel my life before it started. Even my high points can’t cancel out all the negative, and I’m tired of looking for an end that’s nowhere in sight.",1

"Maintaining Hygiene I'm sure I'm not alone in finding that poor mental health makes it difficult to keep on top of hygiene related tasks sometimes. I personally really struggle to motivate myself to brush my teeth even though I know I should.

I think the thing that stops me is worrying about being left alone with my thoughts while I do that- I can't distract myself easily by doing things on my phone because one hand is occupied, and using my phone one handed is harder.

Is there anything that others do while brushing their teeth (or other tasks) that helps then overcome this barrier? I've tried watching YouTube videos, but the effort of finding one I'm interested in seems to be creating enough of a mental barrier that I'm still finding myself procrastinating.",3

"This is a long read but it is needed for context.Also TW - Sexual assult(18M) - For the past 5 years I have struggled with my mood badly because of bullying and anxiety related to past trauma and stuff. In the past it has mainly been a reason out of my control as to why I have felt so crap. But since early last year it is been my own fault.I was in a fairly serious relationship with a girl. Of course, us being teenagers we were quite sexually active. However, I grew to almost expect the sex and in the end, one night it resulted in me misreading the situation completly and I sexually assaulted my girlfriend of the time. The person I cared about most and loved.Most people will probably read this as black and white and immediately judge me, as many of the people around me have. Ever since a rumour started going round at school I started losing some of my closest friends. Friends some of whom I had been close with since childhood. I do not blame them, these days there is a lot of pressure of not to be friends with someone who commited such a vile act.The problem I have had with myself is that, days after the incident happened and I was told through a mutual friend between my then girlfriend and I how she felt, I immediately went and called my girlfriend. (Since the pandemic had just begun so we could not see eachother face to face). On this call, I had the sudden realisation of what I had done and the seriousness of what I had done hit me all at once, resulting in me, someone already prone to anxiety, to have a full on panic attack where I voiced the worst case scenario that was in my head of:""Holy shit what I did was fucking illegal and I could go to jail. I could go to jail and my life would be over.""Of course, I was not thinking rationally at all and I was not thinking about the impact of my actions and how I should have tried to apologize properly or something different. The conversation we had did not achieve anything except do both of us harm. We would continue to date well into the summer until we ended it. From that day on I felt some guilt, to the point where I did not really fully quite trust myself and I was treading extremely lightly wherever I went. I did not feel the confidence to start another relationship at all and I was contempt with it feeling that perhaps a break is what I needed.Come the Spring of this year. In the UK there is been a huge surge in awareness about sexual violence and stuff due to the Sarah Everard kidnapping, rape and murder. A new ""testimonial"" site called ""everyone is invited"" gains a lot of traction on social media. Me being someone who usually sees themselves as an advocate for social issues and change and stuff, I decide to one day have a look at the website after a couple days. I am scrolling through reading all these horrible situations people have experienced thinking to myself, ""god this is so disgusting I cannot believe-"" and then I come across a story that sounds all too familiar. I knew immediately it was about me. I read the testimony in full, and then, did not know what to do with myself. Not only did I now feel ""exposed"" but new information had come to light to me regarding how my ex felt about the entire ordeal, including my tearful panic attack call. In the testimony it said she felt that I was only thinking about myself on the call, that I was selfish and had completely disregarded her completely in that conversation. Naturally I broke down into tears and could not sleep a wink that night with a million thoughts in my head about what I did, how terrible a person I was, I am a criminal and how I do not deserve to live anymore. It took 2 days for people in school to work out that the ""anonymous"" testimony had been written by my ex and how I was the disgusting perpetrator described in it. And from then on it has been a constant downwards spiral for the last 5 months. I have not been able to look in the mirror without thinking ""what a disgusting monster you are you do not deserve to breathe"" or whatever. You know, self hate. I have completely lost confidence socially since I lost all of my friends so I am second guessing every single person I meet even the bloody barista at a cafe thinking ""they know they know they know"". I cannot trust myself sexually at all. Any time I have an urge I get an overwhelming sense of guilt resulting in anxiety afterwards about ""I will never be normal and be able to enjoy anything again"". And then of course due to the nature of what I did I get the thought ""you deserve to feel like this, if you do not feel like this then you are not sorry and you are not forgivable"". I brought this upon myself so this time i deserve this depression. I do not know what to do with myself and I honestly believe that I deserve to die. And that is it. I have never felt this close to being able to kill myself before but... This time it really does feel like the right and only option.But hey... Thanks for reading my essay of my life right now... I just wanted somewhere to feel like I am being listened to since I have felt like I have not had a voice at all these last 5 months...TL;DR I made the biggest fuckup of my life and the guilt that has arisen from the peer pressure and myself has made my already pretty bad depression even worse. This time I brought it upon myself.",1

"I live at my parents house, I don't have to pay bills, I don't have a job, I don't study, BUT I still feel stressed out and exhausted. Even without a job and responsibilities, I still have so many things that I have to do, or worry about. Why is life so stressful? What can I do about it? I have to work on my health. I have to make doctor appointments. I have to go to therapists. I have to maintain my friendships. I have to figure out which religion I'm going to follow (I believe in God but was grown up atheist, so religion is what I'm figuring out currently). I have to deal with friends that got mad at me, or are about to leave me. I have to deal with my mental issues. I have to fix my laptop and my phone. I have to figure out what career I wanna do in my life. I have to enjoy free time. And alot more things that I didnt think of right now.

I \*have to\* to so many things, that it drains all my energy and motivation. If I had a job, or was still studying, it would have been MUCH worse for me. Its the reason why I was forced to quit studying earlier this year.

I worry about so many things, and I have so many things on my to-do list, it is simply more than I can handle. This feels like a 168 hours per week job that never ends.

And yes, I do take free time to relax. I play videogames, I go outside for walks, and ofcourse I sleep. HOWEVER, I always feel guilty when forcing myself to have free time. ""I have so many things on my to-do list which is growing bigger every day, I should be working hard to prevent my to-do list from getting bigger right now, but I'm wasting my time on entertainment right now"". With this feeling in the back of my mind, I cannot really enjoy free time that I take (which feels like cheating, its like borrowing money because youre in big debt, but here I'm borrowing free time from the future because I'm in big debt) I cannot relax. No matter what I do. Whetner I'm working on my ""have to's"" or trying to relax with free time, I always feel like there is so much that I still have to do, and my motivation is completely 0.

My life has too many ""have to"" activities, which I cannot all do at the same time, but I always feel guilty about not working as hard as I could. On the other side, I completely have no motivation to work on anything.

My to-do list grows bigger every day, and it's making me insane.",3

I ask my friend most of the times but the anwser is always so obvious that I start to feel embarrassed to ask and I am scared that I am giving her extra stress.What can I do to clear my mind and do my work? I do not even have intrusive thoughts, I actually I have nothing in mind but it does not feel clear either and I struggle to have a logical thinking to work. What can I do? Advice for numb days",1
Sat at the drive through at freddys and just cried.. why? I watching a couple at the apple bees across the street and asked myself why do not I have anyone? Why does no one love me or want me? I have dated girls on and off.. my last one was my one. I loved her more then anything or anyone. She cheated lied was selfish a classic narcist and yet I stayed with her till she left. Now I sit back and just wonder why am I not allowed to have someone? To be happy? To at least achieve partial American dream.. now I am a single parent who is trying his best but feels left out in life. Sitting back watching others with complete families and me... go without. I dunno anymore. what is so wrong with me? Why does no one like me or love me? What is wrong with me?,1
I'm a horrible person. I've been fighting with my mom often. It's taking a big toll on the both of us and I've recently started to think that she might be right about how I am selfish and horrible to her. I'm so tired of things at this point and has thought of ending things multiple times. Telling her how I feel and think never is possible because I get so scared. I'm such a bad person where I can't even respect my mom but also so useless as I get to scared to end things.,1
"one day i broke down into absolute tears and was rushed into the counselers office. at this point im in 8th grade and this is by no means acceptable behavior. we are about to go into high school and i just burst into a ball of tears in front of every last one of my peers. the good thing is, this scenario made me care a little less about what everyone thought of me due to the already absolute embarrassment of myself. My mindset, the people i surrounded myself with, and my family life were all fucked to say the least... especially family.",0
"Going to Battle HA? Hi All,

First time posting here. So grateful to have found this community. I have struggled with HA for the last 10 years, with each year worse than the one before. 

For the last 6 months, my HA has been with leukemia. Usually my anxiety with any illness is from a few days to a few weeks, but never on the order of months. Enough is enough! I no longer want to live in fear of any random bruise (I am thin and bruise like a peach), or to have my husband constantly reassure me that I don’t have cancer and engage in my safety behaviors. 

A relative of mine is actually a clinical psychologist who deals with anxiety disorders. She referred me to a well-respected clinic that is able to work with my insurance and they want to schedule me for the intake. 

The problem? I’m scared to actually take the next step and start therapy. I’ve avoided dealing with my triggers and upbringing that promoted me becoming this way. The clinic specializes in exposure therapy for anxiety disorders and I am so scared thinking about putting myself in even controlled situations that will manufacture my anxiety. 

Has anyone successfully done therapy and conquered the HA monster? I just need to pick-up the phone and make the call. Would love to make progress on this in 2018. Help?",2

"I been feeling depressed since I can remember.The first time I tried to off myself I was 5 years old but ever since I gave birth to my kids I been suppressing this feeling but the thoughts have always been there. This past few months I been dealing with a lot so I been honestly trying to ignore my depression and everything that comes with it. So with that said I went over my in laws to pick up so mail and my MIL and I started to talk and I made a stupid mistake to complain about my husband since I literally have no one and it just kind of happened. Now she thinks I am having an affair and she is mad at me I did not say anything that she does not already know. This made me feel horrible about myself and all the feelings I been suppressing came all at once and my suicidal thoughts are worse, I am not going to do it. My kids are literally the only thing that keep me going but I cried everytime I am alone I have to fight the urges to self harm. I am incredibly lonely and I just want someone to talk to. This has been the hardest week so far",1
"This week, I was dealing with depression and anxiety, and I was on YouTube when I came across this guy. he is talking about life, mental health, politics, and other topics.

I understand that EVERYONE has their own pain and sorrow, but why am i always comforting someone else?Throughout the entire year I tried venting to them, just to get cut off with their problems.Even AFTER my moms death, I am still getting burdened by them.None of them attended the funeral or came to see me.I overthink a lot, so am i wrong for wanting to block them on social media and change my phone number?One of these friends i considered my sister.

Not really sure where I am going with this post but if anyone has had something similar happen to them I would love to hear some comforting words and some strategies I can implement to put myself back onto the road of self improvement.

So my girlfriend now has depression and I am supporting her in every way possible. She also has this overthinking thing. We had few fights earlier but we solved it in a really healthy way. But she started overthinking about everything and now she is questioning her loyalty and her feelings. she is like there is this voice in her head that tells her she is not the she thinks she is. But I trust her and believe in her. Sometimes those things she overthinks hurt me a little but still I listen to her everything and try my best to make her feel better. I need help like to how to cope up with this situation and help her come out of this thing. Were too broke for therapy. So yeah Overthinking and questioning herself,1
"Hi I am a 20yr M from Australia. This is my first time ever attempting something like this as I tend to have trouble talking about the things that go on inside of my head. I have been suffering from depression and anxiety from the age I was 12, though later on in life I have a few disorders that come along with that. The reason I am writing this is because I have been slowly getting really bad and it is getting to the point were I do not see myself making it much longer if I cannot change my ways. The problem there is it has been almost three years since my last job because of covid and well my inability to work because I honestly cannot face the real world because every time I do something happens that sends me back to thinking that if I work I will become suicidal again. I have no friends left and when I mean none I mean every weekend for three years I have spent on my own. I am worried about my mental state and what this is doing to me, my sleeping schedule is ruined I basically sleep during the days and am up all night do not eat enough food and do not really see the sun at all. I do not know what I am hoping to get out of this my expectations are not very high at all but if it did maybe someone who has been through similar situations older that can give advice or even people around my age like this. All I know is that I am scared of what I may do to myself and that I will not live past this lockdown in Australia. Anyway I am going to bed because its nearly 1 am because I did not sleep last night at all or today and I want to try and reset my sleeping pattern. I hope everyone is doing well and if you have not heard it lately I am insanely proud of you for trying your best. Depression overload",1

apology if this is confusing i m having an anxiety attack while writing this like most people at the start of the pandemic i got sent to wfh which eventually turned into permanent wfh i loved it my job doesn t involve speaking with people unless it s on my own time and i m only in charge of a handful of people and only deal with the people who need the most help i got to sink into my own little bubble and it s coming back to bite me i ve realized my social anxiety ha gotten so much worse than it ever ha i have so much fear just speaking to other people that i feel insane acting like this recently a promotion became available and i don t want to apply i made the dumb mistake of telling my partner about the opening and he s pressuring me to do it i feel physically sick at the idea of doing this some of it is because i m going to be judged but a lot of it is because i will have to do more in the sense of talking to people i can t get away with meeting a month with people i already know it will be constant employee contact and even meeting with people i don t know i m stressed if the pandemic had never happened i could do it i use to be able to flick a switch and become a whole different person at work who only had minimal anxiety now because home is work i can t feel that separation i try to make my work in a different location within my house but it s not easy with my house set up i know i m going to have to do it whether i want to or not because we need the money and the benefit also i wouldn t be able to forgive myself if i didn t at least try but i m so scared i m worried if i do get it that i will be having constant anxiety attack until i m use to the job i just don t know if i can mentally handle that i m worried if i don t get it i will just be constantly overthinking and causing myself anxiety over not being good enough it s a lose lose situation for me and there isn t anything i can do i just want to run away and bury my head in the sand but i can t so i ll do it knowing the consequence and hope for the best,1

"Our society sucks. I mean it is definitely better than it was, at least mental health is becoming more normalized. However, it still has a long way to go. Currently helping out my sister in law with what kind of lie (that is based in truth) to tell her boss why she needs a semi urgent doctors appointment. Because even though employers ""say"" they support mental health, we all know the levels of acceptance and denial in the work force, and she does not want to look ""weak"" and ""emotional"" in front of work competitors and miss out on promotions. Currently we are going with the ""doctors appt for sleep apnea"" and ""doctors appointment for anemia"" rout (since anxiety induced insomnia is part of the problem, and anemia really could be part of it).

"Hello there. I am going through a very difficult period for a few years and I cannot seem to find the light at the end of the tunel.I am just an average guy, 19 years old. I do not know what is wrong with me. When I go out with people (which happens very rarely), I just overthink everything they say and try to see if their words actually represent any hidden messages, if they are talking about me, etcetera.I always feel like they invite me just out of politeness and that I am actually not welcome there. I just cannot wait to get home and be on my own.When I get home, I usually drink or smoke weed by myself and that is the moment when all the tension and anxiety accumulated throughout the day finally let us go of me. I fucking hate it, really.I also do this because I cannot sleep. I just lie in my bed for hours and think about all my problems and all that could go wrong when I am sober. The night is usually even harder for me than the day.Sometimes when I go out I can pretend all is well, I laugh and tell all my friends how great my life is, how happy I am and all of that. I am obviously lying because I do not trust any of them and cannot open up to anyone. Not even my family.I fantazise about having a girlfriend, traveling the world with her and waking up with her in my arms. This is what keeps me going. The problem is that I completely forgot how to talk to any girl. My last (and first) girlfriend was when I was 15. I was different back then. I had sex with her, but she was the only one. I love her and I hate her for what she has become. She has obviously moved on, even though I was the one to break up with her.I tried sites like meetup, just to meet some people to talk to. I signed up for an event and when I got there I completely froze and I went back to my car and drove home. I just cannot socialize anymoreI thought about suicide, but fortunately I still have a tiny bit of hope that I might get through this. However, it does not look too good for me.I just need a friend to talk to. I need a girl to love me for who I am and to understand me. I am tired of recording voice memos and talking to my phone just to get some weight of my chest. Anyways, sorry if I ruined your mood but I had to get it off my chest. Its been 4 years. cannot get myself to open up",1
"My life has been slowly going downhill for 3 months. i got fucking screwed by my job and now i only have 10 after working for a month to only make rent, got hit with rent and bill increases and now supposedly have stress induced depression. My therapist(who i now cannot afford anymore) has suggested i get sleeping pills and antidepressants ontop of my pcos pills but I am soo scared of the anti depressants; I do not want to be (no offence to anyone) a robot which sounds horrible but I am soo scared that everything will become dull but right now is not much better. I want a hug but my mum is 250 miles away and keeps sending live, laugh, love quotes.I had to withdraw a application for a job today because they wanted 3 massive 8 hour tasks to be completed before they even selected you for an interview and even though the money is good on top of already having 2 jobs to eat and manage to get to work, all i want to do is sleep all day. Its hard not to blame myself, i feel soo fucking dumb .I am always soooo fucking tired. i wake up at like 4am just because and cannot go back to sleep ever. My flatmate has come to ask me to do more of the chores and I have now burst out into tears (pathetically) because I am soo tired to do all of them, I also ate his food because I am always soo hungry but then full after eating 2 meals. I cannot live a normal life, eat or cook or do anything other than work and watch anime just because I am soo broke and tired all the time.I have had mental issues in the past and it felt like no one believed me or did anything because i was not long term or severe enough. Its hard to even listen to my therapist saying I am depressed.so my question is; how did it feel to be on antidepressants? can i go back to the way i was before? will everything feel just fine? will my doctor believe me? Also, can i have a hug? I do not know what to do",1
"Hello dear reader, Today I have been staring at the abyss and I feel so drawn to it, I feel it calling my name softly and gently, I feel like I should just give up. To many bad memories haunt my mind and cloud my thoughts, I still remember the first time I got hit. I do also remember being punched for being gay at the age of 13 by older men in their 18's, I also remember being raped by 2 cops when I was going home from my office when I was 21, I remember swallowing a lot of pills when I was 7 and tightening a rope around my neck when I was 9. I remember loosing an amazing friend one summer day because I did not feel like seeing him at all, because how could I explain that I was feeling vulnerable for the assaulted I have lived in the past, I remember how my father stop seeing me because I was not man enough and I did not know how to catch a ball with my hands, I remember walking home when I was 8 during a hurricane wanting to be blown away by the gusts of wind and I remember loosing the man I loved that die during a tragedy. A man that always told me how strong I was even though I do not have the physique he used to have, he was muscular, strong and kind as a gentle giant, still he always looked at me when we wake up as I was ""Hercules"" or some hero of the ancient times and he used to say: ""My love I wish someday I could be half as strong as you are"". &amp;#x200B;I want to jump into the abyss or more like just stop holding on to life, but I do not want to die. I want to live, I want to leave behind my bad memories and my demons and my errors. If you God can read this I still believe with all my heart in you, I also know that you can see me. And in fact you are right here next to me, trying to reach my broken mended heart. It is silly to think that falling into the abyss will solve anything, but I am loosing my strength I have zero today, my heart is aching and my soul feels heavy and numb. I will not quit on living because I do want to deserve a happy ending, I want to be a nice, gentle man. Not a perfect one, not even a happy one. Just one with a future for me to build, I do not dream about travels, love, hope, boyfriends, friends, videogames or anything at all.I just want a second chance please, I will make it count and I will be humble about it. And that is my letter to you dear reader as you I do try to fight my very own darkness to keep it at bay, so that monster will not swallow me and let me still in my bed while my family sleeps on the same house. I have feel so much guilt in my life for being here, for being alive, for being able to breath. While so many people has lost their life due to and illness or an accident or a murderer. So my brothers and sisters out there can any of you help me lit my light because the night is here and I feel my light dimming and dying out, so please anyone out there.Be kind to me and bestow a little of your light so I can traverse this night and not fall into the void.With tears in my eyes, your brother Alex.

in the next days i had the worst chest pain i’ve ever experienced and i definitely thought i was gonna have a heart attack and die, one day it got really bad and my heart raced like crazy and i was shaking but no one was around and after a couple of minutes i was ok. i guess it was a panic attack (never had one before) so i brushed it off like nothing happened. 


in the next months i have been having these weird chest pain i thought i had a problem with my heart, but as days went by i noticed that the pain gets so much worst when i think about certain things. i’ve done so much to get rid of the pain yet it seems like it only gets worst.

i was watching a video on youtube the other day about a medical case and when they started to describe the symptoms that the patient had I HAD THE WORST CHEST PAIN SO FAR!! my heart was racing and my chest tightened i couldn’t breathe! 

googled it and got an “anxiety test”, idk what to do. it really fucked me up i thought i was crazy. 

p.s: every time i get the chest pain i would google my symptoms and only get “HEART ATTACK” and “IMMEDIATELY CALL 911”, it makes the pain way worst….

i need tips on how to control my anxiety please!",2

"Recently, I was forced to leave my year old semi feral cats as I relocated to a new area, and the poor, skittish creatures could not handle the change. So they stayed while I moved to my new place. I have been a wreck since then. Almost everything in my life reminds me of them. I miss them unbearably and do not know how to cope. I have been crying throughout the days and I just do not want to do anything other than either cry or hug my cats somehow. They were my closest companions in the lonely post pandemic world. I cannot even fully express my feelings to anyone in real life because they will all make fun of me. I am in so much pain right now, worried sick about my cats who keep crying for me, I have been told. This is terrible. Being forced to leave my cats has triggered a downward mental health spiral",1

"Your brain could throw intrusive thoughts at you regarding ANYTHING that is really important to you - i.e. things you wouldn't want to be ""wrong"" or ""under threat"". But, bear in mind, your brain is trying to help you, it wants to ""check"" that these things are safe. Your brain also likes to save energy. So if you DON'T RESPOND to a thought, your brain will get the message that this thought wasn't ""useful"" and stop throwing it at you.",0
"I do not know what is wrong with me.It feels like my head's empty. Like the lights are on but nobody's home. Like I am existing on autopilot, and the only reason I do things is because I am expected to do them. Make plans with friends, I stick to them. If I have got unstructured free time, I let it just waste away. Unless it is in the routine, and I can do it without thinking about it, it is going and gone.I spent my whole life like this and not worried about it. And I have been successful, at least professionally. But then it hit me like a car to a brick wall. And once I realized it, once I realized that I do not have a clue about what I want or what I enjoy, and that I have just been coasting through life like a leaf in the wind, I have been terrified. Reliving the choices I made to seclude. Realizing that I have pushed everyone away. Acknowledging that I do not think I have made a real decision with real consequences in my life. Knowing that most of my time on this Earth has been spent in a void of experience, most of which I barely remember. I spend it alone. With not even my thoughts to keep me company. Blissfully unaware of how this is not life. Until recently.I am seeking help and I am seeking treatment, but still.I do not know what is wrong with me. And I hate that I could not acknowledge that sooner. The Void",1
"Like dude, you (the host) are the only person I know. Help me out here. I am a younger millennial and hosts my age never do this. And then they leave you by yourself while they flit from group to group socializing, not handling hosting duties.The only time I feel comfortable mingling is when there is a game or another loner I can approach, but no one plays games anymore and nowadays we loners are old enough to just leave, so there are not any anymore except for me. Its VERY rare to have someone approach a loner so I try to be that person, even though I have very very seldom been on the receiving end of such a gesture. If I join a group conversation, I am treated like an invasive weirdo. Never addressed with words, only glances and glares.It kills me that people are just cool with me being by myself.

"I am motived but I can't put myself to do / complete things I am the happy-go-lucky type of person, I have a good life, with a fantastic wife, a very nice house, a lovely dog and a great car. I have no financial issues either, actually you could say that I'm pretty rich in life - financial but mostly generally 'in life'.  Also I am reasonably healthy - I need to work out for some stamina but I hardly have any overweight, don't smoke, don't drink, I eat healthy. Sounds great, right? 

I was burnt out in 2021 because I worked 24/7 for many years - and even though it feels like the burnout is mostly gone, I can't really get myself to do anything.. and it's starting to get to me - I am feeling frustrated about it more and more.

Honestly don't feel like I am depressed. I feel happy and mostly relaxed w/o anxiety. I am absolutely motivated to do a lot of things - both in the work and private spectrum.. maybe I even want to do too much stuff. I REALLY want to do all the things in my head and achieve new goals. But I sit on the couch and then when I want to start with something I just can't get myself to do it. And when I do, I don't finish it.

Examples are typically:

* I have some great online business ideas and I can start them all myself from my home office. I start the projects but I never finish.
* I have a great gym at home and I want to work out at least a few times a week, but I just don't do it.

Daily tasks are not an issue and I do them with pleasure - e.g. cooking, cleaning, administrative tasks, garden work, etc. It's not a problem at all. I am guessing because they are small isolated tasks that I can finish and then move on.

Anyway, I had intakes with a couple of therapists and they all say that they think I seem very good and not depressed, that I should do more fitness and are not sure they can help me any further. And even though they're right - I should get more fit - but I really doubt that's what is keeping me from actually doing/finishing things.

Maybe it's just the last burn-out issues I am experiencing or is something else? Depression anyway? Or something related? Thoughts?",1

Despite how thankful I try to be with what I have in life, I do not feel happy, fulfilled, or satisfied. My goals and purpose are dissolving. I feel unnoticed and unguided. I constantly imagine myself being shunned when I reach out. I feel detached, and completely helpless. I wanted to grow and always stand apart from those around me. I have always wanted to become the most interesting person in a room. I thrive on social life and love people and try to be my best version amongst people. I try to look my best without forcing myself to be conventional. I try my best, yet I get miserably opposite results. I try my best, yet am able to attract nothing.

And stuff that usually make me happy cannot distract me much anymore.I suppose this usually happens when I undergo a lot of anxiety or stress, but I dunno man. When I edit videos, it feels like I am doing a crazy ton of work, but in reality the work I do is PALTRY compared to others. And also I feel as if I have less patience and tolerance than other people, and that results in me getting heated and worn out faster.I just want to get out of this hole, man.

Daily torture with This.. Ok so I have a lot of sinus. And post Basel drip. But every time I swallow. I have this lump on the right side of my throat. Which feels like my tonsil.

"I hate to admit it &amp; sounds strange to admit it even though I have anxiety thinking about death sometimes. Hearing about someone committing suicide, I get sad but then a lil jealous. Jealous like wishing I had the balls to just go through with it one day, wishing Id stop caring how it would affect my loved ones around me. I have been severely depressed for over 5 years now, nothing helps. I am a single parent too &amp; that is my main reason why I am even still here besides the anxiety part. I love my daughter to death and would do absolutely anything for her like keep living through my absolute misery. I cannot be 100 percent honest with doc or therapist or feel like Id get her taken away and I have no one else to care for her really. I wake up every single day with complete dread inside me, I never feel good either, I feel like there is an elephant in the room constantly no matter where I am at. A dark cloud follows me everywhere. Empty, blue, numb, dreadful, miserable 24/7. I cannot enjoy a single thing at all, no joy felt whatsoever. I am exhausted constantly, I just want to sleep all the time to get away from life &amp; myself. I do not do a single thing I use to like or find interest in. I cannot focus on anything. Also existential crisis thoughts all the time. I have isolated myself, do not like people anymore, everything is so pointless to me. I fantasize about suicide every single day. I hope that I keep finding the strength to go on for my daughters sake. God help me if I lose that only single strength eventually. I feel like one day whether a month or 2 years from now, Ill just give up, not care and proceed. Idk. Thanks for reading I get a lil jealous when I hear about someone committing suicide",1

In some ways you may feel weaker now, but considering that you've lived through your darkest day already, are you sure you're not just stronger in an unfamiliar way?

"This may be the best way to describe me. I am an emotional potato. I have been suppressing my feelings for quite some time now. But I will try my best to express myself here.I am depressed. Or at least I think I am. I am not sure anymore. Maybe this is something everyone goes through and I am just overreacting. I do prefer to be asleep, there is a certain bliss with sleep. I find it difficult to generate the tiniest amounts of willpower to do anything. I can pick myself up for a bit, maybe for a week. I can be the best version my current self can be. But it is hard to stay motivated too long.I can distract myself, with games, working out. But I question if distracting yourself by being busy, even productive busy, is any real way to live. Is it really living if I avoid the pain, bury it inside, and go on with my life pretending to be normal? I cannot tell if that is the right answer. I am considering visiting a psychologist, but idk if I should considering I may be just feeling how every other human does.Writing is not my forte and I am not sure if I have made any sense here today, it does not to me, but thank you for reading through^~^ I am a potato.",1

"Last night I felt close to death. I wanted it to come. I was tempting it to snatch me up. But nothing came. I kept drinking, thinking that the more drunk I became, the thinner and thinner the line between life and death would get. I thought I would get liquid courage to do what I am too scared to do.If the people I called friends knew why I started to drink more, I wonder how they would act. One is worried about my failing mental health, but she will be fine. I mean she is only worried because it is the natural thing to do when it is in eyesight. it is like someone being concerned for a fallen person in front of them. you are not going to ignore them, but you are not going to do a follow up or wonder what is up with them after everything is all said and done. it is similar. Besides, someone else can fill the spot. I honestly do not know why I am writing here, let alone what to write. I guess I am just saying what is on my mind. Things are feeling hopeless again, but I guess that is fine. Maybe I will bounce back, maybe I will not. Only time will tell. Another close night",1
"I wished for this. I literally took steps to get here. And all it makes me.... It makes me feel worse. Yeah my dates keep bailing on me, but people that once called me a best friend want nothing to do with me. Maybe I can reach out again, but chances are they will still ignore me. I literally brought this upon myself and it sucks. I mean, in high school, this is what I did. I boxed everyone out and only one person cared enough to stay. I thought I was happier then but no longer is it good for me. it is really just over. It really is. I burned those bridges and now I regret it but what am I going to do? I literally intentionally did it so it is not like it was not my fault. it is over with my friends. It sucks but it is. No more gaming groups no more talking about my problems no more helping others no more friends. I am no longer a priority and while I hate it it is my fault. And chances are, they do not care. And chances are, almost no one will care. I am not thinking about ending my life, and I am in therapy, but right now I am just working through trauma. This pain I am feeling feels endless and I only have a void inside to work with. I feel like I have lost all that I am. All that I was. Like I do not even stick to my motivation anymore. I definitely deserve this. When you make bad choices you have to live with the consequences. But it makes me feel empty. Like I am a horrible person. Like all my trauma weighs heavily. I cannot help but call myself terrible. I cannot help but insult myself. What am I supposed to do? Nothing. I do nothing. I leave all these people behind and I try again like I always have. I will be hurt for a while but eventually a new group will take me in only for me to abandon it. The times of happiness are getting shorter. From 4 years to 2 to less than a year and I already messed up. it is over man. Why try anymore. All I do is hurt people. I deserve no sympathy. I deserve no kindness. Someone who acts like me deserves nothing good. Can I even blame them for treating me like this? No. I wished for this and it came true. Jump onto the next train and hope and pray that maybe this next time I will stop sabotaging my own happiness. How am I supposed to care? Quick answer, I am not. No one can care about me. it is just over. Again, not ending my own life. Never will. Just living in a void and it is staring back. No smirk, no smile, no frown. Just nothing. I tried to box out my friends to avoid being cared about, and now they are ignoring me.",1

"Anticipatory anxiety ruined my chance at a vacation. I'm so tired of trying to fly and failing. 28M.

I've had a lifelong fear of flying that feel well-prepared to take head-on, especially the fear I've had around taxiing and takeoff. I've flown before, but it's gotten harder to get through the process without running out of the airport dizzy, panicked and overwhelmed by guilt in the past few years.

Specifically, I took a program called SOAR designed to help fearful flyers manage their fight/flight responses around takeoff and aviophobia, or *fears when the plane is in the air.* I felt confident in the last few weeks that I could do this. 

But as I lay on my side writing this, I realize I was completely unprepared for the anticipatory anxiety ahead of the flight.

I woke up at 4 am this morning in a cold sweat. My extremities were numb. I couldn't get a 10-minute patch of sleep in without my stomach seemingly twisting into knots. The last 17 hours has been a waking nightmare of existing in a moderate to strong panic attack state. My appetite is nonexistent. I'm barely able to drink water. Every nerve in my body is screaming at me to tell my friends that I can't go on the spring break trip we planned.

It's crazy, I'm a grad student and I have never felt as tired as I do now just spending this day holding myself back from tears and a full breakdown. 

I'm so tired that a beach doesn't sound nice right now. I just want to curl up in my bedroom with no direct sunlight, to sleep, to cry, to indulge in self-hatred for having a response this extreme to something so commonplace in life for a lot of people. A vacation is the one thing I need right now, but trying to take one via flying has destroyed me. I'm lucky that I had nothing to do today, because it was not going to get done. 

I don't know if this thread is a message in a bottle, but it helps to get it out. If anyone has been in a similar situation, I'd love to hear it.

I still want to fly, deaparately. It's one of the big things keeping me from living my life on my terms. But having to spend almost 48 hours in utter hell is not worth it.",2

"Every time I open up and actually try talking to someone, I feel like it was a horrible mistake and I should have never been honest or allowed myself to be vulnerable. I struggle with rejection, fixate on what is wrong with me, and then I question the motivation of anyone who actually wants to spend time with me. What do they gain from this? Is it simply pity that motivates them? I think the reason I feel so disgusted with myself (part of it anyway) after I share my feelings with people is that I have basically blown my cover and revealed myself as being horribly insecure, unhappy, and unstable making me about as unappealing as possible to be around. it is a cycle of despair; I feel alone, reluctantly confide in people, and time after time, watch those people disappear. I return then to this fixation on my flaws and ultimately, arrive at the conclusion that I need to suffer in silence or at best, in anonymity. How do people live like this?

"I have been cleaning out my camera roll today and I keep seeing photos Id taken of myself. Fun selfies, little videos with my favorite songs, outfits that made me feel good. I cannot remember the last time I did that. I cannot remember the last time I looked at myself and wanted to keep looking. I have always struggled with how I view my body (gender dysphoria plus body dysmorphia), but it makes me really sad that things started to get better then got so bad again. I was not doing well at all mentally but at least I had that. I do not know how to express all of how this is making me feel but its not good. I wish I could go back in time and hug my past self. The 7 y/o old stepping on his mothers scale. The 10 y/o shaving his arms because someone said they were too hairy. The 12 y/o getting migraines every day because someone made fun of his glasses.The 14 y/o wearing two bras and getting up hours before school to cake on makeup, praying that being a pretty enough girl would fix things. The 16 y/o hacking up blood and still feeling fat at 80 lbs. Every version of myself deserved better. They deserved so much love from themselves and the people in their lives. I realized I have stopped taking photos of myself again.",1

"I accidentally sniffed hand sanitizer. Should i be concerned? so i had just sanitized my some hand sanitizer, (Unsure of brand) and i happened to catch a wiff of my hands, it was an extremely strong smell, and i felt a slight burn in my nose initially, think i'll be ok? i already feel extremely stupid right now and i'm wondering if i have brain damage or something.",2
"Brain amoeba First of all, thanks to everyone who participates here. Finding this sub has been a huge encouragement to me as I've realized I deal with increasingly frequent health anxiety. 

My current concern is with the brain eating amoeba. I spent time in a hot tub that wasn't properly chlorinated this weekend. Shortly after the hot tub, I got in the shower and ummm.. picked my nose rather vigorously. After doing so, I thought about the warm hot tub water, so I blew my nose then used saline spray to clean out my nostrils. 2 times in the last 3 days, I've gotten really dizzy and lightheaded, feeling like I was going to fall or pass out. Today, I've had a bad headache and have felt extra sensitive to light. No fever at this point. 

Allow me to think out loud:
- can the amoeba even enter the brain from picking your nose?
- is it possible that the amoeba would have just been in my nostril, then I helped it further up towards the brain with the stream of saline solution?
- would a headache associated with the amoeba come and go or be constant/progressively worse?

I know a much more effecting outlet would have been distracting myself or using other anxiety relieving techniques.. but I couldn't resist venting on here. I'm struggling! I know the questions I posed are mostly unanswerable. Just needed to ask them ""out loud"" rather than let them cycle internally.  ",2
"Ever since I fell into this depressive episode I cannot handle any responsibility no matter how small or how important it is. I keep my phone on airplane mode all day so no one asks me to come and do anything. I have not reapplied for university courses because I cannot fathom how I am going to handle that if going to the grocery store gives me huge anxiety that I cannot handle so I just do not go. I literally sit in the same seat in the park for 16 hours each day with a bag of chips and a bottle of water, just waiting for the day to end. I used to be highly motivated with multiple hobbies and going through Engineering school. Now I have lost all that and even worse, I have lost myself. cannot bare responsibility anymore",1

"Feeling pretty stressed about this 


I (M20) have a crush on this girl at the drama club at the community college I go to. We met about a month ago. I did ask her if she wants to get some dinner sometime, but she said she isn’t looking for a relationship right now, but if it happens, it’s fine. (I told her that we’ll go as friends, but of course that was a lie).

Today, we took down all of the sets from the show we did. A group of friends were talking to me and one of them said that I can ask her if she wants to go bowling. However, me and her don’t have any classes together, so I’m gonna have to ask her over text since I forgot to ask her earlier today.

What should I do about this? This is actually the first crush I had where I actually feel comfortable with her. (Meaning, making good eye contact and all that).",3

I really just need to be okay.I have no where to put this anger. I used to hurt myself and that is all that I want right now. I just want to hurt myself because I hate myself. I am the reason I am this fucking miserable. Because my fucking body refuses to heal. I want so badly to hurt myself physically. it is the only thing that makes me feel better. I injure the thing that is causing me pain. And the pain I because myself helps me stop thinking of how shitty of an excuse of a human I am. I really do not think life should be this hard. If this is how it is suppose to be for me, then I want out.My body is in so much pain 24/7 that it starts feeling all mental. How long will I last like this? How long can someone go day by day in this much pain and not wish for death.This is where it gets tricky, because I love my family. But at this point all I do for my family is hold them back. And make them sad. I hate myself so much and I do not know how to stop. I want to hurt myself but I am already in so much pain. I want this all to just stop. I need strength. So badly.

"Obviously enjoyment is a struggle period, but a lot of us can at least remember a time when we enjoyed our personal hobbies, even if it was for a fleeting five minutes every year for years. Be it writing a song, painting a picture, sipping tea with a book, a walk in the park at sunset with no one around, meeting with friends or family, whatever. But collective happiness/enjoyment seems unreachable and I cannot remember a time when I could partake in it. Collective would be such as what is going on now with euro football - people at work talking about it, taking a day off for it, meeting up at the pub to celebrate, getting hyper and rowdy etc. I just think...what is the point? A few rich folk kicking a ball brings millions of people happiness, even though their actions of kicking a ball is so alienated from you as an individual? This could be for anything, so it is not the sport/hobby/rally. Could be the world cup, the Olympics, basically anything that can be a collective. Does anyone feel this way or can express this better? Christmas is another collective I would always felt my depression worsening, because it starts in September in the shops and basically demands a collective celebratory approach as it leads into new year where many countries blast off millions of pounds/dollars/euros into the sky for five minutes of collective enjoyment, when it could be spent on health or education or homelessness, and I would rather celebrate christmas enjoying a day, and only a day for it, with good food and good company.

"Are You an Introvert with Anxiety? Anxiety. That emotion warning us something threatening is just about to happen. Life-saving when we are genuinely threatened, damaging when we become constantly anxious: anxiety is tiring – it is meant to be. We are only meant to be anxious for very short periods. When prolonged, it isn’t just tiring – it is exhausting. Sound familiar? 

Introverts. Those of us who prefer calm situations and environments. We prefer to re-charge on our own. We often enjoy losing ourselves in our own thoughts. We tend to have small, close-knit, social lives it doesn’t mean we’re anti-social!

Not all introverts experience anxiety, and you don’t have to be an introvert to struggle with it. Many introverts deal with anxiety, though, so this is quite common.

Here are the key signs you’re an introvert with anxiety:

· You’re more prepared than most others because you’ve already thought through the worst-case scenarios.

· You have a tendency to over-think things and pay too much attention to your negative self-talk.

· You feel you always have to be doing something – being busy (which is often different from being effective) may be a means of trying to cope with the anxiety.

· You tend to prefer routines to novel situations. While this can be fine for periods, boredom and unexpected issues arising can easily throw you in to a spin.

· You’re often nervous without showing it – many become very effective at masking their emotions as a defence mechanism. 

· You are more likely to perceive situations as being more dangerous than they really are - anxiety primes us for the fight, flight, freeze response making us more likely to over-react to a low-risk situation.

· You have tendencies towards perfectionism. This is often allied to beliefs such as ‘I need to please everyone’, ‘I need everyone to like me to be a worthy person’.

· Nervousness can throw your chatter in to over-drive: while you normally only speak when you have something significant to say (and you’re normally sure of your facts before speaking), nerves can have you chattering away in an attempt to over-compensate.

· You often have trouble sleeping – either getting to sleep a-tall, waking through the night or waking way too early 

Being an introvert with anxiety can be hard. Thankfully there is help at hand. Anxiety in its many guises is one of the most common issues Solution Focused Hypnotherapy therapists helps people with.

"My mom doesn’t care anymore I (24M) have been dealing with anxiety and treatment resistant depression for the past few years or so. It’s gotten very bad and my mental health has deteriorated as the days go on. I’ve started struggling with really bad brain fog and confusion and it’s really freaked me out lately. I’ve been unable to work since mid last year and still live with my brother and mom. My dad moved about 30 mins away a year and a half ago after my parents got divorced but they stayed friends.

The past few months have been hell, dealing with the brain fog on top of the other issues, and not being able to find a doctor to take me seriously. I’m surely at a loss. My mom has began dating again and is legitimately obsessed with online dating. Buying every membership to every site imaginable, talking to a different guy every night and most nights she’s going out. Now this probably wouldn’t bother me but when I have so much going on, sometimes I just need someone to talk to. 

I was always extremely close to my mom, she has always been there for me but lately she really doesn’t even seem to care. Her only worry is that “I’m afraid you’re going to hurt yourself” but she doesn’t want to do anything to help me. She told me this morning that she wants me to go stay with my dad and I’m so hurt. I’ve lived here for 24 years and I just want to feel clear headed again. Idk what to do and I feel like my parents hate me. I honestly feel like I have nobody.

I do go out with friends a lot of nights or just hangout to get out of the house, I workout so it’s not like I’m just sitting at home waiting for her. But you can’t even have a conversation with her without her staring at her phone. I’ve honestly never seen anything like it and I can’t imagine losing my parents emotionally. I’m at a loss.",2

I need some advice and help.Have a lot to say and want to talk about but I do not know where to start and how and it will be really a huge post.But I really remember the day my depression started...it showed up suddenly while I was playing a game on my mom's phone. I was watching the character's special attack animation and she was beautiful made my heart pump a nice pump (Like that pump when you see ur crush) , and after that pump i felt my whole energy going down and my muscles down as well and was like spidy when he said "" I do not feel so good...I do not know what is happening"" Cuz I really did not know what is happening and since then I begun a long journey till now with anxiety and sadness and now Numbness. I really want this to go away...I want to just feel again...even to feel sadness again.It started on the beginning of my senior year and now I am kind of a lost doomer with really lot of good things but I cannot feel any.

"I need a little help. My first post and for some reason the first time opening up about my own internal struggle. Hey guys, I’ve been struggling with anxiety for the better part of 7 years. I’ve always been able to keep it under control but after having a near death experience in my teens, my anxious nature has been directed towards my health. For the past 9 months I’ve been experience various symptoms, consisting of brain fog, muscle twitches all over my body. sharp nerve pain that seems to come and go affecting everything from my legs, to my wrist and fingers. muscle buzzing (primarily in the feet, feels like a cell phone going off under my foot). This worry of ether a neurological disease or a serious infection such as Lyme seems to dominate most of my days. I constantly make the mistake of self diagnosing using discussion posts of users (on various sites) with similar issues and I realize it’s a recipe for unhappiness. This type of worry feels at times like an addiction that I simply cannot stop coming back to.

I live an incredibly charmed life with an amazing family and incredible fiancé. And I realize I’m not hard done by in the traditional sense. 

But this anxiety surrounding my health is something I’m desperate to manage but more importantly be done with. 

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated, and THANK YOU so much for taking the time out of your day to read this.

I am tired of always being second. I am never first. I am always just someone is after thought. With my parents I am always doing everything wrong. I could find the cure to cancer and they would still be mad I never did more. I recently got keys to my work place and the entrance code and I was so happy because I always wanted it but never got the chance to ask and when I did get it my parents just got mad that my cool news was not that I got full time hours. Whenever we go out it is always about the dogs. And yeah I get it. I love them. But I am always at fault if I do not catch them when they run away. But if I ask to put them on their leashes they say it is not nice to have wild animals on a leash and that it is torture to them. I cannot tell my friends about my problems because then I am a burden and they have enough stuff. I always get picked last for sports or just forgotten all together. I cannot swim with family because I am a trans guy and they do not feel comfortable seeing my chest after too surgery. And I can ask my friends to go swimming but I feel like I ask them too much. it is always me asking people for stuff first. Never them. I am never on their mind. And if I am it is just to ask me to do something for them. Or a favour. I even relapsed on sh because this m just so hurt and empty all the time. I am never good enough. Ever. I am just so done. I know I will never be enough for anyone and I really just need to stop trying. The only thing I should try at is to kill myself. But then if I fuck up and end up alive I will just be even more of a dissapointment Not enough and probably never will be,1

"I grew up moving a lot and for that reason I do not have many long time friends. Childhood friends? None. I do not think I even know how to make friends anymore because every person I meet at work or college I think are just colleagues and do not even like me outside of that environment.Since my fiance proposed, I have been facing the fact that our wedding is going to have a bunch of people he knows and like, my family? One or two friends of mine? That thought makes me insanely sad, and I do not want him to feel bad about having more friends than I do, but I know I am lashing out on him.Everytime we go out with his friends, he says I am rude to him and to other people. He says I either try to take all his attention to myself or I just stay there, watching people and saying nothing - which he thinks it is rude.That has happened a lot of times in the last three years and I have been thinking about how I do not have more than two real friends and maybe that is why I do not know how to communicate or behave. I do not know if I suffer from social phobia, if it is just my depression and anxiety or if I am actually rude. I think I may be crazy. Like, actually crazy.Its been so hard that everytime I need to leave the house to meet his family or friends, I feel like throwing up, I get so nervous I keep imagining how everything is going to go and how I should behave. Should I say hi and hug people? Should I just stay quiet? Maybe I should just stay on my phone, or try to talk to people? If they ask me something, how should I respond? Should I smile, should I even continue the conversation or just answer the question?I do not know how I am going to live like this. I feel like I do not ever want to go out again.

"It's like an unending barrage. If I thought I managed my anxiety poorly before, oh boy. This last month has been easily the worst in terms of anxiety I've ever experienced. 
My first born is due in two months. Farming season is about to start. Constantly awake until 3-4 AM reeling about the real possibility of financial ruin due to the costs of having a child and the current state of the agricultural industry. The thought of changing careers only amplifies my anxiety x1000. That's the worst part, being unable to sleep. Sometimes I'll start to go asleep and the slightest noise will wake me up, or I'll just wake up in a full blown panic. I've been spending all day either being a nervous wreck and if I'm not outwardly nervous, my body is still showing physical symptoms of it. Almost like it's subconscious. Sometimes I feel like the anxiety itself is scarier than the situation I worry myself sick over. My other new trigger is every little ache, pain or cough I get I spend the entire day spiraling down a hole thinking I'm obviously dying and I won't be there to see my daughter's first steps and the farm that's been in my family for 5 generations will be sold because nobody will be there to take care of it. 
I hate the physical symptoms the most. The fast heartbeat, constantly being on edge, body and headaches. It's like even if I think I'm getting a rope around my anxiety, it's still there in my subconscious wreaking havok on me. 
I'm sorry if this was convoluted or hard to follow. I just don't have many people I can talk to, and if I can, they have a hard time understanding just how hard this affliction makes things. These things I'm worried about are valid, certainly, anybody who isn't nervous about having a kid isn't in their right mind I suppose, but having a generalized anxiety disorder coupled with panic attacks in the first place just makes it hell on earth and makes you not only question your own abilities but also question your own sanity at times.",2

Literally, a couple of mins ago a video of those appeared and well, it gave me a panic attack.

I dont know what to do anymore, blocking that kind of content is no use and deleting the app isnt a solution too. I've tried it before but those videos start appearing on my instagram and facebook.

"Anaphylaxis fear This is probably the most ridiculous manifestation of my health anxiety yet. I've basically developed an anaphylaxis fear, mostly related to food, even though I've never had a food-related reaction in my life. 

You hear all these stories in the news of people randomly having anaphylaxis reactions and my scumbag brain assumes it's gonna happen to me. This has made eating pretty much anything an incredibly stressful experience. Eating is one of my favourite things to do, especially trying new food and anxiety is even affecting that now.

Does anyone have any advice? Or even some statistics that could perhaps put my mind at ease? I am worried this will turn into a full-blown eating disorder in which I only eat limited quantities of what I consider safe foods.",2

"I was a little confused at what they meant so her husband decided to meet me and talk to me about what was going on. The way that he put it, he was saying that my husband wouldn't get physical from what he could tell, but there are boundaries that he passed. Unfortunately, he couldn't provide any examples because he couldn't remember what was said, but he could remember the feeling that he had, and it was disgust. This was during the holiday season when their company had an influx of new people and they would be gone within a few weeks because the work they do is very physical and not a lot of people can handle it. My friends husband told me and quote, ""There's friendship, there's flirting, which he did but its innocent because everyone flirts, but then there's certain boundaries that you don't say to someone else while being in a commited relationship or marriage with someone else and he was doing that.""",0

"Heart Failure? Male 17

&amp;#x200B;

About 6 months ago i had my first panic attack. This was accompanied with palpitations and i was shaking very bad. I thought i was having a heart attack. I conitnued having these panic attacks but I understood that I wasn't having one heart attack every day so I tried convincing myself it was anxiety. I went to see a doctor after a while just to make sure nothing was wrong with me and I got a referal to the hospital to have a 24h EKG taken. I did and they noticed some ""extra-beats"". My heart rate was also pretty high for short periods during these 24 hours for unexplained reasons. I assume anxiety. I recently got another referal to a cardiologist and I am going to do a lot of different tests to make sure that nothing is wrong. I got the referal to the cardiologist 2 weeks ago but I haven't recieved a letter, phone call or anything. So who knows how long it will take? I recently started having a cough. It feels like theres some wet thing stuck in my throat and I clear my throat all the time. I can sometimes feel it in my lungs as well. This accompanied with shortness of breath. Now I have managed, thanks to the help of Dr. Google, to diagnose myself with Congestive Heart Failure. Has anyone else experienced anything similar? I am starting to lose patience.",2

"Hey! So I am trying to get better at life. Eating better, exercising, actually doing uni classes, learning French/chess, gaming less, etc. The issue is that I started so far back from normal that I am still pretty pathetic, especially on the uni front. For context, I come from a very accomplished family. Not going to go into detail but my siblings are all geniuses. In jr high Id get 85s and even 90s on a report card and still be somewhat disappointing. Eventually I decided to just stop trying. Currently trying to reverse that. More context: last October I was very depressed and struggled with suicidal ideation. I have been tracking the number of hours I work each semester for a while and that semester I calculated it to an average of 0.7 hours a day (5.0 = 40 hr work week). I got help and got on some meds. Now I am at 2.1 hours a day (uni)+ learning French + chess + reading + exercise. I know its still really bad but I have basically tripled my output and I am proud of myself for that. I tried sharing my improvement with my family last night and I literally got laughed at. Like I know I am still considered lazy but GOD I am SORRY I WAS BUSY TRYING TO SUPPRESS THE URGE TO KILL MYSELF. It takes a long time (for me at least) to recover from that.

"Fear of Brain Aneurysm presenting as Headaches and Pulsatile Tinnitus So for the last five years or so i (26m) have had some various symptoms that i am not sure are simply me being aware of them or something much greater. In particular I experience Pulsatile Tinnitus, where i can clearly hear my heartbeat thumping in my left ear much greater than my right. Exertion makes it much more noticeable. Occasionally I also experience mild to moderate headaches that seem to follow a distinct line from the back of my skull to right behind my left eye. Some mornings, if i sleep on my left side, I will wake up with a headache on the left side of my head that throbs in time with my heart, and laughing/sneezing/straining can create a very -weird- sensation in that same area behind my left eye. I don't know if i could describe it but to my HA-addled brain it seems like what you'd feel if you had a ballooned vein suddenly swell slightly.

I also have been experiencing a slight visual disturbance in the left eye where lights and bright objects have a small, shimmery 'smear' above or below them, hardly noticeable unless I'm looking for it but still strange. I know symptomatic unruptured aneurysms can cause double vision but this seems to minor that I couldn't trust whether or not this is what 'double vision' entails. I have 20/20 vision, don't smoke, drink, or do drugs, no family history of aneurysms to my knowledge (my grandmother did die of a stroke; she was 86 though). I did have a MRI done when i first encountered these symptoms about 5 years ago and they found nothing; the visual disturbance was there during that time but I'm unaware if the pulsatile tinnitus was.

I've had a long, bloody history with Health Anxiety and I'm reaching out to you guys to finally admit that i've got a worrying problem. Can anyone shed light on if my fears are justified?",2
"okay, let's sit down.",0
"I've been making a fool of myself for the past month This is going to be long, sorry. I just really wanted to let this all out and I figured this is the best place to do it.

I've always had a little bit of health anxiety, but it typically subsided very quickly. It was never something that had an effect on my life until recently.

One night in early December I was playing a video game for several hours and barely moved. Eventually I had a pain shooting up my left leg and it appeared to be swollen. My mom suggested I pinched a nerve, but I just knew it was a blood clot. My symptoms were a mild pain in my leg and ""swelling"", Google told me I was about to die, and I was thoroughly convinced.

A few days pass of me obsessing over this. I read about DVT for hours every single day. I'm basically an expert on it at this point. I know all about taking blood thinners and the effect it could have on your period. I was preparing myself for this life.

I measured my legs to compare them many times a day. This had me believing the ""swelling"" wasn't going down. Turns out the left side of me is just fatter than the other half and I never noticed it because the difference is literally less than a cm. Was I *ever* swelling? No idea. My mom measured her own legs to show me a difference in the size of your legs was normal, which only kind of comforted me. Briefly wondered if she too was dying and didn't know it.

Somewhere around this time I thought I had sleep apnea because one night my anxiety was so bad that I was jolting awake every time I started dozing off. This fear faded pretty quickly since my obvious blood clot was my biggest priority.

After those few days passed, my anxiety finally won the battle, and I went to the ER. Shocking news: I did not have a blood clot in my leg. I thought this confirmation would make me feel better, and it did for a few days. But my (mild, barely noticeable) leg pain persisted and after all my DVT research I decided I was among the extremely rare few who had an inaccurate ultrasound reading.

6 days after the first ER visit, I had an excruciating muscle spasm in my leg. Surely the blood clot has moved up into my thigh, I thought. This was accompanied by my lower back feeling like it was on fire and the fiery pain radiating down into my leg. My mom once again suggested a pinched nerve. I was in hysterics at this point so I ignored her and went back to the ER.

They did another ultrasound. It was negative. I had sciatica. Started googling that to make sure it could cause the symptoms I had (it can). The pain was goddamn miserable, but I wasn't going to die.

You'd think at this point I'd be good, but my mind had other plans. I developed a cough. Welp, the blood clot was real and must have traveled to my lungs. I'm dealing with a pulmonary embolism now and death is imminent. I believed this for a few days before finally accepting that it was fucking ridiculous.

So after about 3 weeks of this hell I finally moved on from my blood clot obsession and just focused on healing the sciatica. Had a nice 2 weeks or so of feeling like I was back to normal mentally, until this week.

I had a pain in my lower abdomen. Convinced myself it was a kidney infection. Didn't start off assuming a mostly harmless UTI (or literally any of the many other things that could cause abdominal pain), nah, I went right for the hard hitter. This one could kill me, it's gotta be that one. I considered appendicitis too.

It was constipation.

I was hopeful that my life would go back to normal after the whole blood clot disaster, but now I'm worried that it was just the beginning. I *knew* I was being ridiculous when I diagnosed myself with a kidney infection, but there was still that voice in the back of my head saying ""but what if..."". I was still researching, still getting worked up about it. I don't want to be like this. It's humiliating and exhausting.",2

"Some advice to my people Hello,

I've been suffering with anxiety and panic attacks my whole life, and while I take a ridiculous amount of meds for it including lorazapam, pregablin etc, I was informed about Magnesium and I wanted to share this with you.

So a lot of us get anxiety attacks triggered by the stress hormone cortisol, magnesium works by by stimulating the production of melatonin and serotonin which boost your mood and help you sleep. Magnesium also reduces the production of cytokines and cortisol, which lead to increased inflammation and stress.

It's important that you don't over do it as you can poison yourself with magnesium, and you also have to make sure it's aspartate, citrate, lactate, and chloride forms as oxide apparently doesn't absorb as well.

Speak to your pharmacist or Dr if you're mixing medication, but I have been able to reduce the amount of lorazapam I've needed since starting mag and its helped a lot with sleep. I'm truly impressed.",2

"Today I went to a restaurant with my family while on vacation, and it was one I had not been to since my ex and I went when we were together over 3 years ago. I cried in the restaurant and could not stop. After he dumped me with no warning, I spent 6 months crying every single day and was suicidal. I had to go to therapy but I only had 2 sessions because I could not afford it. But I am mostly better with that, although I still have my days. I will return to therapy once I get a full time job again and can hopefully afford it.So yeah -- I just started crying in the restaurant because it overwhelmed me with memories (same restaurant but different location). Guess I am still not over him. I have not tried to date since, I am not even interested in meeting anyone. I always had mild depression but I feel that break up was so traumatic that it broke something inside of me. I felt a piece of myself die. Has a traumatic event made you feel like that? Did your depression get worse? Idk the point in this or what I am asking for -- I just needed somewhere to write this and get it off my mind. Thank you everyone.

I finally washed my hair after almost 10 months. The thing that helped was on one day I sat down and untangled my matted hair with my hand as much as I could instead of reaching for the comb directly. It took me an hour. Listening to a podcast helped. The next day I used a comb. I think I did this about twice in those 10 months. it is not some great achievement. But I wanted to record this to remind myself of the hell I have gone through. My brain is such that as I am slowly coming out of the fog I berating mysef for the lost time forgetting that I was heavily depressed.

i am year old and i finallly came to the conclusion that i need help with anxiety i signed up for therapy and will have my first session in a couple of day prior to the therapy session i met with a prescriber to discus medication they recomended starting me off on zoloft or lexapro in general i tend to think of medication a a last resort not just for thing like this but in all aspect for example i rarely used medinces perscribed to me for pain after surgery and would only use them if absolutely necesarry i don t even like taking ibuprofen for a headache unless it is unbearable given that i am trying to figure out whether or going on anxiety medication is necessary for me or not i am worried about going on something for the rest of my life and am a little concerned about the side effect on the other hand i have been reading some post on here about how much med helped people i am hoping to hear from some people that have been on any of these medication and what their experience were also if anyone ha any thought on whether or not someone that is new to this whole anexiety improvement journey should jump into med or just try therapy first and see how that go i always kind of ignored my anxiety and told myself that since i have been able to graduate from college with a good degree hold down a great job for several year and maintain good relationship that my anxiety must not be that bad but a time go by i am starting to feel like it is getting worse and is negatively impacting my happiness and is leading my to lean on stimulant and alcohol too much which doesn t seem like a long term healthy way of handling this i have also had a couple of concussion in the last few year so i am not sure how much that play into what i am going through i would really appreciate it if some people could speak to their experience or have any encouragement or advice for someone just starting out in therapy and potentially medication please reach out if i can add additional context to my situation to help clarity where i am at also i wa reading some other post on this sub about people being tired all of the time i have spent year trying to figure out medically why to no avail i am starting to wondering if my axiety is causing it can anyone speak to any experience or epiphany they have had with this thanks garrison,1

so it all started in december 2022 when i had a full blown panic attack that was then followed by an intense fear of d3ath and 30+ physical symptoms that didn't turn out to be terminal illnesses like i expected.. all of these weird symptoms subsided except for my sore/mucusy throat thats followed by a burning feeling sometimes..my throat feels so tight most of the time, makes a growling noise, is full of mucus and i tend to cough..

here are the things doctors have told me:

1- first doctor told me its nothing but a simple sore throat and i was prescribed hot drinks and over the counter flu meds (result: nothing)

2- told me i have GERD/acid reflux and i was prescribed Gaviscon and a few other meds related to this matter (result: felt a lil better but not that better) 

3- third doctor did a culture test on my throat and figured i have  streptococcus bacteria residing and chillin in my throat , i was perscribed KLACID 500MG for 10 days and i felt somewhat better but then my throat got bad again

4- fourth and final doctor said its a simple sore throat and prescribed me hot drinks as well..

"I was diagnosed with clinical depression (anxiety disorder, panic disorder, mood swing), REM sleep disorder, and ADHD at age 26. I knew that something was wrong but I did not know what until I hit the rock bottom (unfortunate events happened, in the worst possible place, at the worst possible timing). I tried to kill myself for months and one day I ended up in an ER with cutting my wrist with cocktail of alcohol, energy drink and painkiller. I have gotten hospitalisation, years of talk therapy and art therapy, and now I am only on medications. Sometimes I am good or hyper but usually medications barely hold my moods swing. I was not born in a wealthy family but my parents provided me more than comfortable things - private schools, travels, studying abroad, credit cards and other material things. Which I am more than grateful considering that there are many people have less supportive family/friends not only financially but also emotionally or simply unlucky to not have access to basic needs. Despite fully knowing that I am lucky and I should live with gratitude but it is really difficult, especially as getting old and cannot find a reason to live - hope or dream? I have been to the dark place a few times and I am officially on the list of suicide watch, still seeing my therapy every 2 weeks but I have been going to the dark place again. Maybe some people know that you cannot help but want to go to the darker and darker place instead of trying to fight it. I feel like its an addiction when I feel depressed af I want to get more and more depressed and end my life. Constantly thinking about suicide methods, what to write on my will, how to disappear and die without affecting my family, and how to die but can donate my organs for those who want to live because its not fair some people want to live but struggle.

"This is my first post ever talking about my depression, idk where to start. This past week I have been sick with a minor cold and while being sick it made me realize how much of a loser I am in life. I am currently unemployed and stressed about going back to community college knowing I lost my financial aid privilege from being a careless idiot in the past. My mom has spoiled me too much growing up and I took it for granted. It really hurts me to know I have not accomplished anything in life yet just to put a smile on her face. I had a job back in early May where I working a Physical Therapy Aide position but did not even last a month there. I thought I was doing fine until I got a phone call to not come into work anymore. I cannot even hold down a job ffs. No one in my family knows I got fired yet, too embarrassed to tell them. I do not think I have lasted at any job for more than a year. I have been applying to a few places, but no responses. I think I was meant to be a loser in life. Today was the first day I broke down completely in a long time when I came into a realization that I have pretty much 0 growth since I graduated high school back in 2017. Since middle school, I always had low self-esteem. I never tried to man up. I was lucky enough to be in a 5-year relationship w my high school love. My low self-esteem issues were the reason we went our separate ways when I would always decline invitations to do activities with other people. it is weird bc I do weight training at the gym every week since I was 17, and you would think that would build complete confidence, but the self-esteem issues are still there. I wake up late everyday in my same depressing room, open up my laptop and watch useless youtube videos, gym, come back home and do the same thing. I really have nobody to text or socialize with besides my sister. I would say my older sister is my only friend at the moment. She graduated from college a few years ago and works a job related to her career. She always gives me advice, but I would brush it off bc I am too pussy to completely open up to her. I am going crazy. The day is almost over and what did i even do today? I am a little kid in a young adult's body 22-year old in deep depression. Now starting to go crazy",1

"I really need some help with managing my anxiety when it comes to lack of cleanliness Hey everyone. I'm new here. I'm writing this to be very transparent and to ask for help. I don't want to ruin my relationship or participate in toxic communication habits. 

I am finding that my anxiety really acts up when my apartment isn't clean. My husband and I both aren't the best when it comes to doing the dishes as soon as we use them or cleaning up clothes right away. But I feel like I atleast take initiative and try. I feel he usually won't start cleaning on his own unless it's his own stuff or I practically yell at him to. 

I feel like I shouldn't even have to ask my partner to care about taking care of our home. I can't be the only one doing it. I'm honestly losing it because sometimes I get so frustrated and anxious, I do get mad quickly. How do I change this? It's not even like I want to be mad, it just happens because I've reached my limit mentally. I'm not on meds, I wouldn't even know what to ask for.

I feel like I just don't wanna have to ask him to clean anymore. Why can't he just do it on his own? I don't think I'm asking for a lot and I'm made to feel like a bitch or like I'm lecturing him when I'm all I'm doing is asking me to do some chores. In fact, why do I even have to ask? I feel hopeless. I feel stuck. I can't afford a housekeeper every week right now. 

I can't control him. I just wanna know what I can do to manage my anxiety around this. And please no stupid advice like leave him because we are married. I know this issue can be fixed I just don't know where to start.",2
"Am I weird? My friend came for a sleepover today and we went in my room. He didnt ask or anything and just sat in my bed.

I can't wait him to be gone so I can change my bed sheets and wash everything. He also changed the position of my bedtable And I feel like ripping my skin of, I can't stand the feeling, and goddamn HE HAD SCHOOL CLOTHES ON. And went in. My. Bed. I changed the sheets not a while ago and they were all clean and now not. I  don't even allow myself to lay in my bed with dirty clothes. I need to shower, put on fresh clothes and then I can lay in my bed. I had the problem of people just simply touching anything in my bed since I was little, They always bullyed me and extra jump on it, ect. I always cried because of it and It still didnt change. I'm so sensitive about anyone on my bed, I even feel disgusted if my mom sits on it just a tiny bit. There is no excuse ,everyone I know makes me uncomfortable when beeing on my bed. Does it have to do with my adhd? Is it autism? OCD? PTSD? or am I just weird? I'm slowly going insane, someone help me.",2

"Inhalated AC/refrigerant chemicals Today, I was in sitting in a lounge area of a building at my university for about 10 minutes. All of a sudden, someone (who happens to be the professor of a class I'm in) walks by and asks ""Does it smell like burning plastic in here to anyone else?"". I took a whiff, and lo and behold, there was a *very* strong odor. A repair man eventually determined the problem to be that the HVAC system was leaking fluids into the ventilation. I left the building soon after the professor made his remarks, but I did return briefly a couple times to see if it had gotten better and to retrieve the laptop I left there. 

Since then (this was about an hour ago), I've kinda been feeling a weird sensation in my lungs or possibly my esophagus (not sure). How worried should I be about chemical inhalation, etc.?",2

Meds Help?! 💔 Hi beautiful people. I have pretty bad PTSD with life long anxiety and panic attacks. It is really bad lately and I’m considering medication.  I’m a very happy person naturally and have never been bored a day in my life but the flip side of that is feeling EVERYTHING. Hoping you guys can help me. I was on Lexapro a few years ago for one year. I lost my zest for life but it absolutely saved me during a very hard time. I gained a bunch of weight which was not good because I struggle hard with my weight to begin with. Is anyone on something that did not cause them to gain weight but did work? Im just sick of being in constant fear. I quit caffeine and that helped but lately everything is causing me to panic. Please help if you have any experience with meds. Thank you so much!,2

"Lotta background you do not actually need but if you are curious, its all right there:Long story not-so-short, i have 20 years solid of trauma and health conditions that put me in debilitating pain and unable to move a good third of the time. I have been to a few therapists, was hospitalized after a suicide attempt, largely ignored my last one, was on meds for a brief while and stopped because my psychiatrist (second one btw) said i was making up side effects. After that, i stopped trying. Not just in therapy but also in life. I barely graduated high school (even just a short year earlier having held valedictorian status), i have not been employed in almost 2 years, i smoke weed and cry all day. Every day. Naturally, I have been thinking about therapy again. More accurately, i called every place near me, and after a few months had an appointment with an old ass white man. So in this one appointment, we went over intake and then he said i had not been honest enough, i should just go on medication, heavy medication, and therapy would not help me. Fun perspective considering how hard my former psychiatrists pushed for me to be in therapy, but whatever. It just got me to thinking...... Wow. He did not have a single thing to offer. To recommend medication is one thing, but telling me i would not get anything out of seeing a therapist is something I have never once been told before in my life.Then i thought about my past therapists. Like the family therapist we had seen after my mom remarried. One of the group issues was boundaries, i ended up having a break down about not wanting to be near the family members who had been molesting me for years. Her response? ""Oh, i get it. I was a middle child too, it is so hard to be heard."" Yeah, that reeeeeeally was not it.The next one was before trying to kill myself, i had gone to two appointments and had just finished up the intake. There was a lot i had not disclosed, but quite a bit of issues i had. When i went in to my third appointment, she told me there was no reason for me to be in therapy, i was not depressed, i was entirely fine, wasting her time, and i needed to leave, but it is okay because since we will not be doing the appointment, she would only be charging insurance and not charging my mom her copay.After my suicide attempt, i was required to see another. I feel a little bad about my experience with this therapist, but ultimately i saw her entirely silently for three months (it was a big organization and another woman did my intake). At the first appointment she had given me a ball of yarn and held the other end, ""so we could feel connected through the silence."" I knew she was not the one then, but my mom insisted i keep going. I think at the third? appointment, she had shown me videos of people shaking to relieve ptsd. Yup, i declined doing that verbally. Several times, as she kept asking, one time saying ""i do not even have to touch you,"" which should a fucking given even if i did actually have a therapeutic relationship with her. As time went on, i was shocked she had not notified anyone that i was not actually part of therapy at all, so i had gone in and asked her what she was writing on the insurance forms (bc you need a vague appointment description for insurance to cover it). She said that on the first forms she had written that we were getting to know each other and building trust, but that now she had been writing that we were learning coping skills. I replied, ""so you have been lying?"" And she looked shook, stumbled on words for a second, and quietly nodded. After that, i kept telling my mom i did not want to see her, eventually she said i did not have any good reason to stop, and i asked if my therapist never reaching out to let her know i was not talking was a good enough reason. My last appointment was the following day.My next therapist seemed okay ig, she was at the same facility as my psychiatrist who i stopped seeing, and i figured it would be easiest to just never go back there. Tbh in those 2 or 3 appointments though, the only thing i remember her doing was giving me packets to read.While in the hospital, all we did was group therapy, where no one really talked and i was told there was no reason for me to be crying.So all in all, I am really feeling unable to live and everyone just says to go to therapy. So what the fuck was i supposed to be getting out of therapy? What do they have to offer? Because so far it is actually so little that it hurts. What did your therapist have to offer?",1

"Yesterday was so good but today it's back It's like I had a breath of fresh air. I was sober, I was productive, I was task oriented. I got constructive things done and even worked on hobbies just a smidge. It was so nice to breathe yesterday. Today I started off well and I kept giving myself projects to do. I repotted some things and made the mistake of posting a pic on Reddit. I wanted to share a cute lil repot I did. Now, I know I can't take things on Reddit personally, and some people left positive comments, but some people were judging what I did and telling me I was wrong for it. I sort of lashed out and started to respond to them, but someone told me off for it and I realized I was being unreasonable. 

It's not the post or the comments that got me. It's just that I was trying to do well and be happy and share a little of myself with something or someone  outside of my bubble. I'm a home maker (30F) and I'm alone all day. I have long distance friends, but no one nearby. My friends don't really check on me- we are all mentally ill and I usually put myself on the back burner and stay quiet, so I think they lean on me and don't view me as needing help.i wish they would reach out more and ask me how I am. 

I feel so incredibly alone. I have felt such immense depths of pain in my life. I am still fighting to grow and heal. I wish I could've taken my therapist with me to the new state when I moved. I wish I had just one person who understood the depths of what I feel and how crazy and chaotic my brain is. I wish I could friggin breathe right now. I wish it was yesterday again.",1

"Does anyone else have an extremely sensitive gut due to anxiety? When my anxiety gets bad I get bowel discomfort. My digestion is poor, and I basically get what amounts to an IBS flare up. I had some anxiety for a couple of days this week and I have been in agony for about 4 days now, long after the anxiety subsided. Last night my gut hurt so bad I couldn't even sleep.

I may actually have IBS and it may actually be tied to my anxiety, I don't know. Can anyone else relate to this?",2

"I do not see a point to anything anymore. I believe I have identified it as apathy. But as far as I can rationalize it I exist on this planet to live for an arbitrary reason, and then die. Full stop. I cannot find meaning, I have been trying so fucking hard but I just cannot. I have everything I could want In life but I find joy in none of it. I used to love gaming, and travelling. As of the past couple years I have not felt excited for either in any capacity. I have not felt anger, happiness or sadness in what feels like a lifetime. All I am experiencing is boredom and apathy. I am not even sure if what I am experiencing ***is*** depression, but from what I can tell, its at least a form of it. I have been to therapists and psychologists, I have tried CBT. None of it has worked. I am trying to avoid anti-depressants but I hate the sound of the side effects, especially the ones related to sex. Sex is one of the last things that distracts me from what I am experiencing, although I am afraid I am developing an addiction to it. I am not even suicidal. I just feel so jaded and tired of living. But I do not see a way out. Being dead seems worse but I do not know where to go from here. I am a conventionally attractive, young, college student who is been in a stable relationship for 5 years with a gorgeous, amazing girl. And I am absolutely depressed beyond reason.",1

Long time reader / first time poster in this here subreddit...I've been comforted by many of your stories and they've really helped me through the years with my own struggle. Because of this, I decided to write about (and share) my own story about how I overcame health anxiety.

"I am a university student and I have missed a lot of school because I could not handle my depression.

"Root of my depression? I’ve been depressed for about 4 years and it seems to have just gotten more severe as time goes on. I’ve tried loads of different supplement and antidepressants including methylated b vitamins, fish oil, zoloft, prozac, lexapro, buproprion, NAC, 5-HTP and more. Nothing has worked for me I’m still just as depressed and exhausted as I was when I began, actually even more now that it seems like it never goes away. My symptoms of depression are mainly fatigue, low motivation, low energy, and anhedonia/emotional blunting. This has me wondering could there be a root cause or something wrong with me that has caused these problems? My life is pretty good besides the issues that my symptoms give me, could I have a hormone imbalance or some other problem that causes this? I don’t want to be throwing medicine to mask my depression if there is some deeper reason for it. For all of you that seem to be depressed due to an issue within yourself have you done any testing or anything to find the root cause of the problem that helped ? I’m desperate to get help any feed back would be appreciated.",1

"I want to make some things clear first. English is not my native language (I am not from English-speaking country) so I apologise if you find harsh mistakes in my post or if I mention something inappropriate for this particular community or in general (if it is something really important please let me know and I will fix it). Also, my username was suggested by Reddit.As it says in the title, I am a 21 years old male. I have been living with my grandparents basically since I was born. The desicion that I would live with them instead of my mother was obviously made when I was not really conscious about it. I still have my mother but I do not want to live with her and she does not express a will for that either, not that I would take this offer. I do not even want to talk with this person.With these things said, I am moving to the problems I have. Now I will mention the ones that, while still affecting me in a negative matter, I do not see as primary but rather as secondary. Saying that I mean that I can live with them or even try to deal with them in my future by myself. They are here just for a bigger picture, not much else.1. I 100% have extreme social anxiety. This is why I was not able to continue my study in university. Well, not only this, actually, but also because it was not free and also I did not see any perspectives with my anxiety working a job that would require any social interaction, which means any job outside of the Internet. I found a way around it, so this is dealt with. I just have to study for it and I should have some possible income in future working online.2. I have zero friends. Like, absolutely no one, even online. It makes things harder, but I learned to accept it, and now I think I do not even need them. But that is why I am writing my problems here.3. I do not think a therapist will help me. As I continue, I think you will understand why I think like that.And moving on, here is the primary problem I would like to receive an advice on:I am afraid that I HAVE to live with my grandparents for the rest of THEIR lives. I am the only person living with them right now, and all the people from my family have their own little 'families'. The reason because I think they would not be able to normally live on on their own is because of their problems. My grandfather drinks alcohol every month for 1-2 weeks straight and of course this causes stress for the whole family (but no one is able to fix it), mostly for my grandmother. She has a form of cancer, having which life can be sustained mostly without the need of hospitalisation, though she still needs to be in a hospital every 3-4 weeks for a week. You could notice the similarity between times when my grandfather drinks and my grandmother goes to hospital, but I have to tell you these facts do not have much to do with each other, he was drinking all the time before my grandmother was revealed to have cancer anyways. Well, hearing all that, I do not seem to be a good person, right? Like, being raised by my grandparents and not wanting to express some gratitude? Yes, and I do not feel like I am a good person either. I do not want to blame everything on the others, my fault is also big here.I did not have a bad childhood. Neither a good one. I do not remember much of it, even being only three years out of it. But there is not a single good thing I remember from it, only bad and embarassing things. My grandparents did not make a normal attempt at trying to raise me, I feel like I was raised by myself. Just providing me with food and roof until I magically become an adult. And I did not ask them for anything either, I did not even have a smartphone before I entered university when it became a nessecity. Graduating from school, I thought I would kill myself, but I did not. It was more than a thought and a little less than an attempt. did not have the bravery. Thinking back on that, it was pretty comforting, not trying to improve anything in your life, thinking you would be dead anyways when life strikes you with the need to become a socially acceptable person.Yes, I am an egoist. I want to live by myself, for myself, alone. In a crappy apartment, with no real life contacts, working online and only going outside to buy food. I would even be fine if I had to give 50% of my income to my family if the other 50% can pay me for rent and food. I am sure I would be happy this way. What, is there no place for egoists in our society? Do I have to live the same crappy life all my damn family is living? Or is this just me being depressed about my life, who does not understand other people, who are not depressed. Like, what THESE people are living for?The moment that made me write this post happened a couple of days ago. My grandmother knocked on my door and said that she was screaming my name several times and that she did not feel well and needed me to bring her water. I think I was listeting to music that moment, not really loud (I can understand now why I am not listeting to music at higher volume, it is the moments like this). And my grandfather was unconsious from all the fucking alcohol at the time. The only thing I said to her was that I would hear her if she was screaming. This was literally the first time she was feeling like that in several MONTHS. I feel like I do not have a single minute to relax, I am always stressed because something like this can happen and I always can be interrupted even if it is not shit like that. Like, I feel that if I just tell everyone to fuck off and let me study in peace, I would have much more motivation to actually study and not stare into the fucking screen waiting for something to happen. But I cannot do that. I did not make an impression of being such a person. I act like I am fine and everything is fine. Not that someone actually cares if I am fine or not.You think if I am saying all that I actually did consider asking them if I can move out in future or not. I did not. I am afraid to. But I think that they will that I can. What will happen then? Currently I am the only helping my grandmother in our huge fucking garden and I did a lot of work there by myself. Her health is progressively worsening, and my grandfather continues to drink alcohol. So the things are going to get even worse without me being around.I would love to be a person who would say 'fuck all of that'. Can I be that person? What should I do? I ask these questions mostly to myself, but if you read that far into my post I would be happy to hear your opinion or advice on my situation. Thanks. 21M and need an advice",1

However i feel so utterly horrible sometimes and today is one of those times. I am crying as I am typing this and i just feel so bad about myself. I have not even picked a course for uni and I just have no idea what to pick, I cannot pinpoint my interests and I have no true passion and at this point I am just such a hassle and an annoyance to my family because I cannot get myself together. Maybe I should just pick a course and go with it regardless of my interests? At least that way I make a choice.

"Lately life has not been the best for me , I have been avoiding my family and ignoring their phone calls because I just do not want to talk. I miss family events because I do not want them to see me and ask why I am not okay. Everyday I wake up a wave of grief and depression just wash over me and I hate it. Everyday of my life is a battle and I am getting closer to my edge. I feel like my life is going no where and that the best thing for me to do is just end it all , I obviously did not succeed in this life therefore there is no point in being around just existing without a purpose. I try to talk to my mom and to my brother but they do not understand, they think its not as serious but they have no idea the turmoil and pain that goes on in my mind. I have so much PTSD from my life. In 2018 my grandpa , cousin and brother all died. My brother was killed by his friend on his own daughters birthday and my cousin was murdered at a red light in Los Angeles. that is not even the tip of the iceberg. Throughout my life I have lost so many friends and family to gun violence and I hate it. I grew up going to funerals and seeing my loved ones die young . I feel like I have the same fate in store for me and I am just waiting for the day to come . I never liked living in this world and feeling all this pain and having no one to talk to . It just sits in my head all day . I know no ones going to see this but I just wanted to get this off my chest. Sorry for bothering. Just please check up on your family members when you know they are not okay. Sometimes a small thing like asking someone if they are okay is the difference between them ending their lives and them not doing it Trapped in my head",1
"I need advice. I’ve had Crohns since I was 6 years old, currently 21, and it has affected me more than I realized. My mental health is very bad and has been since 2020. My mother passed away the moment I graduated high school in 2019 and I haven’t been the same since. I don’t have any other family near me to help me out, and I’m alone in my head all the time even though I have a girlfriend. She helps me as best as she can but it doesn’t change anything once nighttime comes around. Once she’s asleep I’m back to overthinking and start crying and want to just end it all. I miss my old life, I miss what I used to have, and I’ll never be the same again. And just thinking about that kills me. I’ve been told many of times to just think about the present instead of the future or past, or don’t think badly, try to think of all the good times and BS like that but it doesn’t work for me. I’m mentally fucked up and physically with my stomach. I physically can’t work due to my Crohns, I’m on the toilet at least 5-6 times a day sometimes even up to 10 times. And it’s never pretty. I don’t know what to do anymore, I’m on a small budget, and I’m just tired of feeling like this. I used to smoke weed but I’ve stopped thinking it would help out in the long run but it hasn’t been any different since I’ve quit. I will not take pills, I do not want to get addicted to anything or be stuck on psych meds. Please God can someone help me find a way to make it out. I’m so smart and I have such a good head on my shoulders but I just physically and mentally can’t work or do anything 70% of the day. Please, if anybody has any advice on what I can do to get the voices out of my head without admitting myself I would be forever grateful.",2
my lifestyle and world view for sure seem like a depressed person no motivation almost everything i do is anxiety driven privately my life is a mess and who doesn t feel like we re all screwed nowadays however i usually feel happy or content at any given moment i kinda just don t think about the problem and vibe i m usually having a pretty decent time i m not often sad or cry thinking about the future is upsetting and overwhelming but i try not to i keep getting diagnosed with depression i can kinda see it but usually when i see depression represented it s either with sadness or with no feeling and talk like not enjoying music or anything i still enjoy stuff though is this a thing do others feel this way edit i started lexapro today and went searching for ppl to relate to but i feel kinda alienated from others who are depressed i feel like bringing my energy to other depressed folk would just make them feel worse about feeling bad,1

so i have a disabling chronic illness last year i went through some pretty severe stuff almost starved to death because my stomach doesn t work properly and won t digest food had to be hospitalized and have a permenant feeding tube placed etc that s just backstory that might be relevant but honestly i m not sure i have this overwhelming anxiety any time anything slightly untword happens to my partner it s particularly unmanageable when it come to them feeling physically unwell i have no idea why this happens it s something i ve experienced in other very close relationship a well but it s not everyone not even everyone i care very deeply about it s super weird and i have no idea where it s coming from but i need it to stop because i want to be supportive and i can t do that if my partner know i m fighting down a lot of anxiety just to talk about them feeling like they might be coming down with a tiny cold the anxiety can even bleed into feeling of anger or frustration which i hate even more because who get angry about something like that am i just a bad person how do i cope with this in a way that doesn t negate their experience by requiring them to constantly tell me nothing is wrong or that everything is fine but also not going off the deep end and feeling crazy with fear just because they might be experiencing discomfort,1

"I find myself getting depressed lately. Ill try to be brief. About a year ago my gf and I moved across the country because she got s good job. I find it hard to deal with our new way of life sometimes. She is super busy with work sometimes and will spend evenings there after dinner. I am left alone. Which usually would be fine, but due to higher cost of living here, I cannot really afford my hobbies any more so when I am home by myself I just kind of lay on the couch. That leads to my mind picking things apart and feeling depressed. I do not feel much motivation to do things with my free time. I get all the chores done and keep the place clean t after that, I am so bored. Boredom leading to depression",1

"I need to rant. I am 19F and I have been in this constant loop lately where all I can think about is what my life could have been if I had gone to the high school I wanted to attend. So my high school has 3 campuses, Main, North, and West. I went to the North campus and absolutely hated it, I was in a dual enrollment program where I earned an associates degree in cyber security which I have no interest in all because my parents pushed me to do it, since I am 1st generation. My parents were together at the time, but when they divorced while I was almost done with high school they stopped caring about what I did and it made/ makes me so angry that I stayed in that program for nothing! I am upset that they made the decision for me when in the end it was the least of their concern what I did with my life. So now I am stuck in this constant train of thought where I wonder if I had gone to the Main campus and done the cosmetology program how I wanted, if I would have made more friends, and potentially been in a few a dumb high school relationships. I wonder if I would have tried out for sports and been more extroverted. I think what also bothers me is that I see people from my middle school who went to the Main campus are still friends based on their social media posts, and I graduated alone in 2020 with no friends and a toxic household. How can I stop doing this?? I know I should stop being nosy on social media with my spy account, but its so hard because they were my friends in middle school at one point, so it bothers me a lot. Help?? I wish I could go back in time so so bad and fought my parents a little harder to take me out of the program since parent permission and signatures were required. All of these what if scenarios drive me crazy",1

"I feel things getting bad again For context 2022 was the YEAR of my life. I lived abroad and had a blast. My anxiety was still there but at a minimal. I never felt so happy. So happy at times I felt like I was going to burst. It was insane. 
February of this year I came back home. Home isn't a good place for my mind. My parents are awful and I always feel like I'm dorwning when I'm home. I've been home since February and I feel things going dark again. I'm sleeping way too much. Have no energy or desire to do anything and the awful thoughts of mot living are coming back. 
I'm in between places right now. Kicking off a new career, that's why I came home. But things are going slow and I cant move away right now.

"is it normal for an SSRI to make you feel like you're literally dying I was prescribed 50 mg Zoloft for anxiety and depression which I took for the first time last night. What followed was the most excruciatingly painful and unbearable 12 hours of my life. I threw up anything I ate, heart was pounding nonstop, my entire body was numb, and I couldn't sleep without being constantly woken up by stomach pain or nausea. Pretty much all the anxiety symptoms I normally get except all at once and multiplied 100x. At certain points I honestly felt like I was about to die or pass out.
I know people say that it gets worse before it gets better but nothing could have prepared me for this. I don't think I'm gonna take another dose until I can talk with my psychiatrist and be absolutely certain this won't happen again.

"Hi everyone, I wanted to write this to see whether or not people feel the same or whether or not I am going crazy. Basically, I am a 26 year old male and I am feeling bogged down by life and quite miserable. To give some background, I still live at home with parents, I have a fairly decent job, a girlfriend and a small group of close friends however over the past few years I have been struggling to feel content with life. I live in the uk and from a young age I have always craved adventure and living a exciting life. During my late teens and early 20s I have lived abroad, travelled the south east, been on multiple holidays but there is something I cannot quite put my finger on as to why I feel unhappy with life at the moment.Over the past few years transitioning from being a happy go lucky university student to then entering the real world has been a real struggle for me. The area I live has very little work opportunities and is known to be a less desirable part of the UK to live in. I feel that everyone does the same predictable routine of, working a job they hate Monday - Friday and then drink heavily on a weekend to numb the pain and then repeat (myself included). I really feel I am growing out of the uks drinking culture and want to completely change my lifestyle.I just feel that there has to be more to life than this. The majority of people I know are looking to get their first house/ engagement and to settle down but the thought of settling for this existence really scares me. I feel guilty for feeling this way, like I should be grateful that I have been dealt a fairly comfortable life. A week holiday once a year, an ok wage, food in the fridge and a caring family but I cannot help feeling that there has got to be more to life than this. I crave community, travel, adventure, good relationships, passion, excitement. But at the moment I feel dull and like the energy has been sucked out of me through joining the 9-5 rat race and falling into the trap that everyone does.I suppose the reason for writing this was to understand whether it is normal to feel like this?Is this just what growing up is all about? If anyone had any tips on how to change this mindset of these circumstances?Is it unrealistic to think life can be exciting all of the time?Thanks for reading and I would be grateful if anyone had any tips or pointers or even just to find if anyone is in the same boat!

"Okay bear with me, this has a bit of a back story to make sense. Two years ago I (M, 32) ended a ten year relationship after finding out she was cheating. I have been dating on and off but never finding that spark with anyone. The last few months in particular I spiralled WAAAAYYY down. Like struggle to get out of bed, removed all my friends from my life sort of level. Over these last few months I was actively trying to achieve a more aesthetically appealing body: Abs, thick shoulders, muscular etc. This involved a lot of working out, cutting out carbs and only eating fish and chicken as my source of meats. My mood levels have consistently been going down despite the fact I am looking pretty good now. I still have not managed to find a girl I have that spark with (I am in Christchurch, NZ and the competition here is pretty intense. Dudes here are jacked, tradies and over 6ft4 on average - I am 6ft, Scientist). Anyway after feeling miserable for such a long time, I decided to get some comfort food... Mince and also some steak. I had both over the course of 4 meals/2 days...Now I am happy. Like legit, I am listening to music and got a hop to my step. I am happily chatting away with people while it was actually a chore before. Honestly I do not know if it is just the red meat that is changed me but I was sooo unhappy before and the only thing that is changed was those recent meals. I am still alone with no love prospects.Just thought I would share in case it helps someone here. I know diet can have a massive impact on brain chemistry. That may be the case here.

"I do not enjoy anything about life. I force myself to exercise, read, and partake in my hobbies because I do not want to be an empty person who does not even make an effort, but that has not stopped me from being miserable. Sometimes getting drunk gives me relief, but I have to stop since I am on the path to becoming an alcoholic and lack the funds to keep drinking at this rate. I live in a dead area and have no clue how I am supposed to meet someone. I am basically stuck in this position indefinitely until I get a much higher paying job. Unfortunately, trying to find one has been a fruitless, demoralizing experience with no seemingly no hope. I probably will not be happy even if I get out of this either. I was miserable in college, but when I look at it objectively, that was the best part of my life by far. My life afterwards has been all work, technical assessments, and interviews with very little social interaction - its soul-sucking and this is supposed to continue until I retire. I just do not get how more people are not lining up to kill themselves; hell, I think about it every day. The expected cycle of life is utter garbage. No part of life is enjoyable",1

I am always seeking opportunities, always trying to learn more about the newer demands of my job, and still, no one wants to hire me. I look around and all I see is my friends from college getting their first jobs in the area, gaining experience, doing amazing stuff and I am proud of them, but I am also extremely jealous.

I talked to close friends about it and all I get is empty words (I am quite sure they are not, probably it is just my mind trying to self sabotage itself).I just do not know what to do anymore, everyone is moving on, doing amazing things and I am here doing absolutely nothing. I do not feel like I get comfort from people, and honestly I do not know why I seek it since it is my issue and I got to solve it own my own.

"I do not care that I am LaZy. I have been trying to restart my life for 7 years and my life now is only shittier than it was when I was 18. I have excercised, dieted, got hobbies, gone to therapy. All of the things the drones constantly drone at you in these forums with their insipid generic platitude. I never succeeded. I always failed, and each time stepped my face into the dirt once more. I do not believe in myself. I have ZERO self esteem. Since I was a kid, I have had nothin to be proud of. Horrible hand eye coordination, always picked last in sports, ooor academic performance, socially clueless. I hate myself. But more than that, I despise everyone else. I want to go on a msss shooting and massacre a bunch of retards so that they will will feel terror and pani, and maybe it would be cathartic. You are all so lucky I have not been able to get my gun license. I am poisonously envious of anyone with something I want. Intimate relationships, friendships, money, a degree, independence, respect, charisma, beauty, youth. If you have one of these things, the best I can do is feign indifference. I cannot pretend to be happy for tlothers any longer. I wish them only the worst. I do not care about fairness. I do not care about who earned what. There is no such thing as deserve in a deterministic universe. I repeat, I would love to horribly injure and ruin peoples lives, not because they deserve it, but because it would be cathartic for me. I would especially love to stab every cunt who has ever yttered the phrase pull yourself up by the bootstraps or other such normie fucktardstion. I am not interested in fitting into this society. I want every single person to die, and for no more to come afterwards. Ah, that would be an antnatalist paradise. I am done fighting",1

"I am lost, adrift, with no hope of rescue and no hope that the future is going to be less terrible. The only reason I have not put my shotgun barrel into my mouth is because I have a wife and kids who are depending on me. Antidepressant medication is just barely doing anything, and I have not had luck with therapy. I am out of options but to continue on this dead-end path to nowhere. The world is headed down a spiral to mass death and doom, and nobody cares to stop it. Everything is hopeless and it does not matter. I deserve to suffer because I am a member of this accursed species. I fantasize about killing myself every day",1

"do not really know where to start so I am going to recount my life a bit. I am a moderately healthy 16-year-old, who started high school last year. (In my country we start high school as 15-year-olds.) My family is not wealthy but we are not in any serious financial trouble. My parents are still together and I would say they raised me pretty well considering. I have an older brother and an older sister, who both moved out years ago to live their own lives but I am still really close to both of them. I love my family and my pets a lot. Right now I think they are the only reason I am still breathing.I have been anxiety ridden and suicidal for about my entire life. I had really bad separation anxiety as a kid so my mom watched over me at home. I did not go to kindergarten because of it. When school started, I used to spend an hour in the bathroom just vomiting bile every morning because of my anxiety. My stomach ached and I was trembling every morning for years. I was just too scared to go to school, because it was a new enviroment and because my teacher was in my opinion really frightning. I missed entire weeks maybe even months from school. I made plenty of friends but nothing could make me enjoy school since everyday I was just a ball of anxiety that was too afraid to do anything. At the age of seven I held a knife to my throat and threatened to kill myself just so I did not have to go to school anymore. that is how much I hated it.Obviously this was not normal behaviour for a kid so my parents put me in therapy. For years it was absolutely useless. They just made me do these weird excersises which I am starting to think was just some random busy work to keep me entertained. The only thing that helped was that they advised my parents to help me prepare for different things. For example if I had a field trip in a month to a zoo, my parents would take me and my siblings there together so I would have an easier time to go there again. This helped for a while but of course in life you cannot prepare for everything. My anxiety never went away but things became easier for a couple of years.When I was about to advance to seventh grade (13-year-old me) my anxiety was still there but thing were going well. Couple of years pass and my anxiety is going up and down in waves but the school was very understanding and complying, all my best friends were on the same class as me, I had a clear image of the future and my individual therapy was going well. Life was going really well at this point and even though I was anxious I could go to school pretty normally even though I still missed many days. At it is peak my anxiety could because me to have migraines so I had to stay home a lot. Whenever things were going bad I thought about suicide but never planned it out.On my last year before high school my anxiety just sky-rocketed and with it I became very depressed. I was not too outgoing before but now I could not even go to the store without anyone else. I did not want see or talk to any of my friends even though I really liked being with them. Before I was a staight A student but I could not even understand the words on my homework anymore. I was a perfectionist yet I did not care if I finished my assinments anymore. My grades dropped heavily. Smallest decisions became just unbearable to make. On some nights I did not eat because I could not choose what to eat even though the fridge would have been full. Some days I could not get out of bed. So many of my hobbies became untouched. I could not play games like before, I could not play he piano anymore and I could not write stories like I used to. I became entirely paralysed.My therapist was really worried about how I was feeling so they told my parents who had no idea. I was pretending to them that everything was just becoming harder in school and that I was otherwise doing just fine even though I was basically dying inside. My mother called my school and told them that she was pulling me out for 2 weeks to recover. I was basically just too overwhelmed and burned out that I was barely functioning. This was the first time I could really remember me putting a plan together to end my life. I was in so much pain. The only things I cared about doing did not bring me any joy just stress and my pride in my school succes was dwindling because I could not keep up anymore. The only reason I did not kill myself was because I did not want to die in pain and I had no idea how to kill myself without going through absolutely no pain. I have never told anyone about being suicidal anymore. Not to my family, not to my friends and not to my therapist because I am afraid of he consequences.During that time my parents prohibited me from looking at any homework, news or worry about outside life. They wanted me to recover without any possible hindurances and because of that they tried to bring me my favorite foods and give me lots of free time so I could enjoy my time playing games. I have never felt so relieved. Before that I was crying in my bed at night just dreading for the next schoolday The freedom of not having to worry about anything was amazing. At the end of those two weeks I returned to school. I was doing fine for a few days but as the school year was coming to an end I was beginning to feel a lot worse again. All that pressure from school life and my own mind had not disappeared. I had just pushed them away from my mind. I became the bitter and sad hermit who disappeared back into my room like I never left.That same old feeling of freedom returned when summer came and my school year ended. No pressure, no expectations. I did not see my friends during that entire holiday or go anywhere from my home. I was happy and safe in my room even though just outside my window I could see how wonderful the weather was outside. I could finally do the things I liked again and I could actually enjoy them this time.That did not last of course because then I went to high school to continue my studies. To my surprise the first weeks went well even though I was really anxious. Two of my best friends were still in the same school and we had lots of the same classes. I spent every moment with them and I had fun. The problems started when I could not go to any of the tests because of my anxiety. I failed a lot of courses because of it and those set backs started an unstoppable snowball-effect. My self-esteem was in the gutter and I started to hide in my room again. I slowly became me from before that two week vacation. I became more depressed again and more anxious then ever. I could not go to classes. I could not do my homework and I couln't participate in any group activity. I started failing more classes even on subjects that I previously could have aced with my eyes closed. I spent almost three days every week suffering from migraines.For the last 6-7 months I have not been to school at all. I have met doctors and I have met with my guidance counselor for more times then I can count. My anxiety is through the roof and each time I explain my problems to the doctors and my guidance counselor, the answer is always: ""We know it is hard for you to go to school because x,y and z. **You just need to try going to school.""**Like I had not fucking thought of that before. I am suffering inside my own head, thoughts screaming how I cannot do shit and how behind I am going to be and how useless I am. For every day I started crying because I was so afraid of going to school. I could not read anything because I just could not understand the alphabets. I am nearly having panic attacks when I just think about going school. One day I became so enraged that I punched my door hoping that I would break my own arm. But thanks, I had not thought of going to school. Right now I have been on summer break again but in a week I need to go back to school but I just do not know how I can. I start crying every time I think about school. I just want to disappear and thinking about killing myself has become an everyday occurance. I just cannot handle feeling this hopeless and anxious every day when I have not even started to live independently yet. I am terrified.Any advice/stories from personal experience or just kind words would be very much appriciated.Thanks for reading this far Feeling lost, this is my situation",1
"Would all this be caused by anxiety? Hello everyone I'm a 20 year old Caucasian male. 5""9 155lbs. I don't smoke, i don't drink alcohol nor use any drugs. 

So it's been almost 1.5 years that I've developed some strange symptoms, that have really deteriorated my life.

They basically started after i caught covid (i was vaccined prior with the j&amp;j vaccine). Since then, i get heart pains all the time. They happen multiple times a day and usually last a few minutes before they go away. I've been to 2 different cardiologists who ran an EKG and echo and said that everything was fine. I also had a  48 hour Holter monitor that showed some pvc's (200/a day),but docs weren't concerned at all. 

Also after covid my WBC are basically running around the 11-13k range (before that CBC's would come back fine). They were fine before i got infected, but it's been almost 1.5 year that they won't go down. My lymphocytes are also high (45-50) and neutrophils low 35-40). Everything else comes back completely fine. I went to a hematologist and he run some tests for malignancies(leukemia) but they came back negative. 

One of the worst symptoms also is the spasms I've been getting all over my body. They can happen literally anywhere and they always last a few seconds before they go away. I've searched a lot about them and i guess it's most likely BFS (benign fasciculation syndrome). But it never stops. I think my nerve system has been permanently damaged. 

Lastly i get random aches in my stomach and usually at the upper left abdominal region. I've had an abdominal echo and it was fine. But i get random shooting pains along with painful gasses. These are the symptoms I've been dealing with the past 1.5 year. They're all so random and I can't connect them somehow. High WBC usually mean infection, so I'm guessing that an autoimmune disease might have been triggered?

I've also found a lump in my arm. It's been there for 1.5 year as well, i showed it to my gp and he said that it's a lipoma, but it's still there. It hasn't grown but it hurts sometimes. Things like sarcoma drive my mind crazy. It feels like my body is constantly trying to kill me. 

The whole thing is causing me so much anxiety and stress. I thought that things would get better with time, but no, nothing has changed and it's been so long. I'm only 20 years old and I'm afraid that I'm gonna drop dead by a heart attack or cancer. I used to be an athlete but i stopped after all these, because i became afraid. I honestly can't live like this anymore. I've visited more than 5 doctors and nobody has a clue. Any ideas?",2
"I am a freelance designer. There has not been much work coming in and I have been getting financial help from my parents. I wished things were better. A few years ago, I was working a regular 9-5 job for a corporation. I had a steady income and felt more free. I enjoyed nice restaurants and going on trips. Right now, I am approaching 40. I have not been in the mood to date. Dating requires confidence, time and money. I have been living more frugally and have been putting more effort into getting back on my feet. I spend a lot of time working on my portfolio and job applications. I have been getting a lot of rejections and it hurts. it is been very competitive out there. Many of my peers have been able to hold onto their jobs and are more settled into their lives as adults. I will admit that I am a bit jealous. I feel like I am stuck in purgatory. I was wondering if you guys could relate? I know I need to work hard on applying myself, but do I need to also put time into my personal life and self care? How do you survive through unemployment?",1

"Everyday I see people just doing the same thing but not making any changes. I watch obese people walking into fast food joints. People just walking on this treadmill of work, spend money, sleep and repeat. Ever since I left the country in 2016 I have just been feeling like this place does not work for me. I do not want to become a slave to the matrix and live a boring life of paying bills and working some boring job and having to pay rent or a mortgage for the rest of my life. it is just stupid to me. But what I really realized is how depressing the US is to me. Seeing elderly people living on the streets, seeing the government slowly turn the country into what Orwell warned, and seeing people just sitting idly by and letting it all happen. I feel like it is a lost because to even speak yo about it. I saw a Jim Morrison quote about this and it fully resonated. I find myself not connecting to 99% of people here. Everyone is just so self obsessed and dull. I do appreciate how many different interesting people are on Reddit though. At the same time I believe people are more authentic on the internet than they are IRL. Regardless, I see alot of people doing alot of cool things, and feel a better connection with people here than in the physical world. I just want to make music and build my brand in peace, not having to worry about bills or paying rent and it is sheerly frustrating to try and do it here. I think I just have to go to Africa for a few months and be around my people. I realized that living in th US makes me depressed and I do not believe I fit in here",1

"what should be the Best time of my life, is being absolutely destroyed by ALS fears I dont know what to do. I have had twitching, muscles in specific areas decreasing, and feelings of weakness marked by certain muscles seemingly taking over for the ones that are lost, such as when i walk, ect. for over three years this has been an issue that i have had to ensure myself that it's nothing, and was able to ignore it blissfully for the most part, especially last year in an exciting freshman year of college. But then, back in august i met an amazing girl and suddenly everything came crashing down. My future was important to ensure for myself, so I started paying more attention to my body for reassurance. And boom. The issue was not gone, and I knew it. It was worse, in fact. It had spread. The next three months were nothing short of hell. I lost myself. No sense of self. Life itself felt super meaningless and artificial. I thought about death daily. How to kill myself in the least horrible way if i got the diagnosis. My faith was depleted. It felt like I actually died inside. And all this at the time that should have been THE BEST of my life, aka honeymoon phase of a new exciting relationship. It effected us negatively, obviously.  Thank God, in december I somehow felt like i came back to life. I can only credit God for answering my distressed, desperate prayers the entire month prior. I was able to focus on my life and my relationship in Jan, Feb, and march, which were all GREAT, with these health worries still present but always able to be beaten. But today i find myself in a situation trying to schedule an appointment for an EMG, in order to finally out this away, after getting dismissed without a checkup back in october. im scheduled for june to get checked and HOPEFULLY sent to an EMG. I just cant let this ruin my life anymore. I need to know. This is the loneliest feeling ever. My body has something going on. I just need to know.",2
Buspar not for long term result? I just left my primary doctor and suggested BuSpar due to all the good things I’ve heard on here. Always turn down SSRIs because of sexual side effects and heard this is better. Anyway she told me buspar is effectively just like Xanax? That I can’t take both it’s one or the other? They’re both an “as needed” drug. Is this true? To me Xanax is a bandaid. Long term won’t change and work toward a cause. She made it sound like buspar is effectively the same even though it’s an SNRI not a benzo???,2
"I think I may have had depression for the last 2 1/2 years but its taken me until now to realise just how bad things have got.From the outside I can imagine it looks like I have the perfect life - I am married, have two healthy and intelligent kids, have a lovely house, and a better than average income but I married someone who does not have the same outlook on life as me.

I think about my brother, and what I could be missing out on, I wonder if there is something waiting out there for me that I do not want to miss.I wish i did not care. I wish I saw no brightness in my future, and I wish I was numb enough to end my life. But I am not, and so, I am stuck. I wish I was actively suicidal",1

i do not know how to write this but i need advices or something like that. i thought i had conquered my bad thoughts on my own but they keep coming and coming. I am just a failure in life. at 21 i do not have a job and somehow i do not have the strength for it. I have only been sleeping for 2-3 hours at the most for days. i just do not have the strength any more. i do not have the nerve for my hobby any more because i know that i feel like a failure there. I have been having suicidal thoughts again for days. no one in my family notices that I am in a bad way and you can actually see that I am exhausted from life. i do not know how to describe it all because it is not easy for me. I am too weak for therapy on my own but I am afraid to talk to anyone about it. i can no longer :( need an advice or something,1
"How do I get over wanting everyone to like me? I am a 20-year-old male. I have social anxiety disorder, and one of my biggest problems with social anxiety is that I am a people pleaser. I rely on external approval from other people to make me feel good. For example, when someone gives me a dirty or unfriendly look I get upset. When someone doesn't smile at me, I think it's because they think something is wrong with me. When people smile at me or are friendly to me, I get happy. I have this attitude that I want everyone to like me. I'm trying to change this attitude. I want to get to a point where I don't care if someone dislikes me or not. How can I get to that point?",2
"Dentist Anxiety Hi I managed to get through my appointment today, but they told me I have to come back for 4 fillings and a root canal and now I'm petrified. 

Does anyone have any idea what I can do to relax before and during my appointment and also if anyone can explain what happens during these procedures I'd be really grateful.

Also, I'm 17 so anyone have any guidance on how to tell my parents I have bad teeth?? As they expect to be perfect but due to other mental health issues I haven't been taking care of them hence my cavities 

Also, how do you know to trust a dentist? Is it normal for them to look in your mouth for like a minute and tell you what needs to happen? 

They didn't take xrays btw.

so i have a mild stutter and i just had an epiphany i ve been letting my stutter control me but i found something amazing out i let my stutter define who i wa a a person instead of an aspect of myself it s so bad that when my parent talk to me like a normal person i d think to myself wow they act like i m normal despite my stutter they see past that and when i would work people would see my name tag and say oh i have a son named my name and i would think he probably doesn t stutter tho i let this define who i wa a a person and i let it really get to me i wa looking at old reddit post from other people asking how people view stutter and most people said they didn t care at all and even found it interesting some even said it wa hot cute made joke sound more natural and a a result more funny not like they found the stutter funny tho and one even said they were turned on by it and someone said something that stuck out to me they pretty much said how you perceive yourself is how others will so if i see myself a weird and anxious i will act that way and be perceived in that way but if i see myself a confident and charismatic and just act like my stutter doesn t bother me and even joke about it then others will perceive me a such this blew my mind a i thought everyone didn t pick up on my stutter at first and just thought i wa super weird but it s just me convincing myself of that so even tho this clicked i still can t just flick the switch off so how do i actually become confident with my stutter it s very mild and is fueled by anxiety so if i can get rid of my anxiety it ll in my opinion make me sound more charismatic and confident so i really wan na figure out how to just own it how do i do this,1

"My story of HIV anxiety Hi there,

For the last month and a half I've been dealing with the worst health anxiety of my life. Prior to this my health anxiety has been me thinking i'm going to have a heart attack causing me to constantly check my pulse. Things along those lines. But my current situation is far more severe. Here it is, I've posted something on here before about it.

I met a girl and we talked for months. She is a sexual person and I am not, it took me months before I finally decided I could move past just talking. After sex with a condom the first few times, we had unprotected sex the next a few times. I know how stupid this is but its even more idiotic for someone with health anxiety as i've learned. We agreed it was okay to do because i had no sexual history and she had been tested negative for stds. After the last time, 2 weeks later i got very sick. My doctor called it the worst sore throat she had seen in a long time. Along with that came chills, body aches, fatigue. I had blood work done my doctor called to say I had mono. I had only kissed this one person, and I asked her she said she had mono 4 years before. 

However, I idiotically googled symptoms. As it turns out, HIV in its early stages has all the symptoms of mono. Combine that with having unprotected sex 2 weeks before feeling sick and immediately I become overwhelmed with fear. I began to notice other things wrong with my body that resembled acute HIV - my tongue has a coating on it that i think is oral thrush, a rush formed on my chest after i started to feel better. Other things started to appear like my stomach began to growl regularly and my legs turn red in the shower. This fear hasn't gone away for a month now to the point of it keeping me up at night and sporadic panic attacks when I think about it throughout the day.

I have to take a test to put this to rest and resolve it. I know how extremely unlikely it would be for me to have this. I asked if she had been tested for stds since and she said she had been very recently. On top of this, im not sure i can ever be intimate or sexual again if this is how im going to act. ",2
i think the worst part of dealing with all of this is the absolute constant feeling of loneliness having no connection to anyone many act like they want to help but a soon a they see how deep and dark it is they back off my phone stay pretty silent unless someone need something,1
"Oh my god… My ex hasn’t responded to me in days, we are still friends and this really isn’t like him and I’m starting to get really worried. I owed him $50 and I asked him if he got it, no response, I sent him a picture of my new pc setup, nothing. Last time we called was a couple days ago and he said that he would call me back because he had to go to class but he never did. I tried calling him just now but to no response. Idk if I’m overreacting but I’m close to tears. Like what if something happened or did he just ghost me. I’m so dizzy from panicking so much, help.",2

"Hello, thank you for reading this, first of all.I wonder if anyone here is feeling or has felt the way I do and has found a way to resolve it.Anyway, long story short, I was always an underdog in primary school, high school, everywhere I went I was the punching bag, I also had bad grades. I was terribly depressed and suicidal all childhoold, which is not the issue here but I feel like it is related to this post. I am an elementary school teacher now, I am also just graduating from university, I think I am not doing so badly. However, since my GF left me I feel like I am going downhill again. I am obsessed with improving myself, studying, just overall bettering myself at anything. I feel like I am just not good enough for anyone. Ever since she left me, it is getting worse. it is like there is this voice in my head that says I am stupid and useless and there is no way to turn it off. It has been getting worse lately. I just do not know what to do. My mind has this idea that during the last year I was procrastinating too much and was not studying enough and is making me feel really terrible. Honestly, I do not know. My mind is blurred. I feel like I am going insane. &amp;#x200B;I have never been to a psychologist, nor will I ever go. I just want the voice to stop. Any tips? Lol. I feel insane just posting this. How to forgive myself for feeling not good enough?",1

"it is impossible to be happy in this cold cruel world. Everything's got to be serious and unfun. I had just spent a day being happy and productive and had thought that I could finally live a chill life being this way, but boom my dad starts lecturing me and telling me he is sick of me gaming and will check my bedroom every night at 1pm to make sure I am sleeping. I am 21. The moment I heard that I knew that a chill life will never happen. Nor will I be happy. This is a life of cruelty and suffering, one that will not let me take a break. I cannot just move out, I will die in the cold. I need to let go of my happy demeanor and become cold, since that is what the world demands of me. it is impossible to be happy",1

"Hi. Please stick with this- I will try to cut to the chase. I have suffered from chronic anxiety and I have battled depression for as long as I can remember. After an 8 year abusive relationship, I lost myself (along with my home). I am still struggling to feel any sort of normalcy 2 years post-breakup (add PTSD and an eating disorder to the roster). It is a complete mental battle to get myself to go to work -although I was unable to work for a period of time-so I am thankful for that, even though my job exhausts me on every level. I am a single 33 year old female with very little to no hope for my life. I go through the day to day motions of working and immediately take sleep-aid to end the day as quickly as possible. I am seeing a psychiatrist (taking Zoloft and buspirone) and trying to stay consistent with therapy. Even with insurance, these appointments are expensive. It is so discouraging. Unfortunately, my poor mental health has caused me to neglect taking care of thingsmostly myself. I just had 3 emergency root canals and require 3 more. Insurance and the care credit I got does not cover all costs. I have resorted to selling everything that I can for extra money and working overtime. I am in so much pain. How do I ask for help? I am embarrassed to try and ask for monetary help and I am sure many will have no sympathy for me, and I understand that, I just feel like I am close to giving up completely. I am so desperate Asking for help, ashamed but desperate, Please",1

"I was diagnosed with MDD about 2 years ago. Since then I have been working with my psychiatrist to find a medication that works for me. This past semester, I hit a different kind of low. This rock bottom state made me miss a lot of classes. I am an engineering student and even missing one class can put anyone very behind. I explained my situation to my professor and she suggested I medically withdraw from the semester. After talking with my psychiatrist and new found psychologist I decided that withdrawal was the best choice for me. The process to medically withdraw is long and difficult because mental illness can be seen as a chronic illness. The board approved my request to withdraw. This is good news. Now, I am in the process of filling out a tuition refund appeal. I have to write a personal statement about my situation. This refund is worth $9,000. Also, I can only submit this repeal once, so I want to get things right. I am having a hard time putting words together to accurately depict my dip (to put it lightly) in depression. Has anyone else medically withdraw from school and been through tuition refund appeal? I had to medically withdraw from school because of my dip in depression.",1
"maximus came home almost four years ago, after enduring years of abuse. he was a 90 pound hunk of love who thought he weighed about 5 pounds. most handsome boy you have ever seen, a pitbull with the biggest block head that i love more than anything. he always had to be by my side, and i always had to be by his. i would lay on the floor with him any chance i had, and he would always angle his head down and just collapse his body into my lap. my boy loved to get dressed up- a bandana around his neck always made him sit up a little taller, and walk a little prouder. he got a rough start, having been used as a bait dog for the first half of his life. his body was permanently marked with scars from where evil scum had cut him repeatedly. when we found each other at the shelter, he had been there for 9 months and been adopted out and taken back quite a few times. ill never be able to wrap my mind around the fact no one else kept him, but I am so thankful they did not and that he waited for my family. he was missing almost all his teeth from chewing rocks, and was blind in his left eye. he has seen and experienced the worst humankind has to offer yet still had more love for us than you could ever imagine. he was my big, goofy, happy happy guy. the biggest regret i have is that i did not get to him sooner than i did. Maximus did not want to eat anything the past few days, and was more sluggish than usual. my mom took him to the vet yesterday just to make sure nothing was actually wrong, and they told us his red blood count was low and he needed a blood transfusion. it was serious but no reason he will not recover from it. we took him from there to emergency vet, where they ran tests and did scans. the vet said he has never seen anything like what was shown on those scans, that my sweet maximus was a very very sick little boy. the inside of his spleen was supposed to look like peanut butter, but instead it looked like chunky jelly with chunks and lumps he could not identify. his body had developed multiple tumors, which were cancerous. he had gone into tumor lysis crisis meaning that a large amount of the cancer cells that were comtained in these tumors died, and released their cancerous contents into his blood. they were killing his red blood cells and destroying the ability to regenerate any at all. his stomach had bloated 3x its normal size, even though it was just later in the day and yesterday morning it had looked fine. the vet discouraged us from treatment because he did not see any possible way maximus could recover- putting him on treatment would only prolong his suffering and ensure he passed painfully. which is cruelly ironic, as putting him on treatment would keep my suffering at bay. but i have to do right by my boy. hes been through too much and endured more than i can imagine, he was brought into this world in pain and i promised him when i brought him home he would leave it in love. i had to keep that promise. i love him more than it seems like my heart can handle, and making the right decision for him is the absolute utterly wrong decision for me. we got the vet this morning and despite not moving except to lift his head the past few days, he trotted off away from the building. i believe in the deepest place of my heart he knew what we were there for, and he was scared. he would not let me turn him around back toward it, and the most he would take was two steps toward the building and then sit back down. i sat down with him and just sobbed. the thought of not having that big brown baby rips my heart into shreds and pierces my soul. we finally got him inside after i just sat with him and talked to him for about 15 minutes. I have never wanted to simply wait in a waiting room longer, but they called us right back. i prayed that the doctor was tied up and would take a while before she got back there, but no sooner did i finish thinking that she came in. i felt myself detach from my body at that point. i cannot remember anything she said, but i know from the time she came in the room to the time she left the room was only about five minutes. my babys body was so tired, it had been fighting so hard for so long. he was gone before the injection to stop his heart was even finished. my world and heart suddenly felt so... empty. i was wailing in the vets office, the pain is so deep. the doctor told me our grief is only a reflection of our love, and i believe that 100%. i genuinely do not think i could love my boy even an OUNCE more because my little heart would give out. I am back home now, my other dogs do not understand why their brother is not here. i never ever expected my maximus to be the first to go. i have two other senior dogs, and maximus is the youngest. i felt so sure i had at least 3-4 more years with him, and i feel so robbed. i was not remotely prepared, i had zero clue this was coming. the one comfort i have is i do not feel remorse over the amount of time i spent with him. i do not feel like i wish i would have sat with him and pet him more because that dog was at my side constantly. any spare second i have I am laying with him. anywhere i go, hes the one that gets up in the car and rides with me. he loves a car ride. i always surprise him with a mcdouble, and the excitement he shows never ever ever gets old. I am not prepared for all of that to be a fond memory. I am scared, because i know in time ill forget how it felt to pet that big block head and i do not ever want to. i tried to memorize everything i could about the way he feels, so i hope its a long time before that happens. but for right now all i can think about is how it felt holding him and petting him and how it felt. I have been in a bad depressive state the past few weeks, and i do not know how I am ever going to feel okay again. maximus is my comfort, i seek him out when I am sad because of the comfort he brings, and now hes not here to comfort me when i need it the most. please be kind to me, I am not in a good place right now. Thank you for listening -K i had to say goodbye to my sweet boy today after finding out yesterday cancer is ravaging his body.",1

"I used to be okay. That is until I got hooked to anti-anxiety medication. Benzodiazepine withdrawal has changed the course of my life.Nowadays I see the world differently. I used to feel part of it. I used to feel like I had a place here. Lately I have felt like an outsider. Like I do not belong. I see people with their morning routines and just think I wish I had some structure like them. I do not have structure. I feel like an alien. Every single person I know has some sort of structure. I do not. I went from feeling like water inside a cup, to water being thrown out onto the street. My life was okay on Benzos. I could function without much anxiety. But I saw the writing on the wall. I was addicted to them. I could not do much without them, but when I was on them I was carefree, risk-taking and relatively happy. A lot of good happened in my life. I got married, was doing well at work and finally felt free from my anxiety. Something Id dealt with since I was young. From ages 24-28, I was under the influence of Xanax or Klonopin. Little did I know, with every dose, I was screwing my brain up. With ever-increasing dosages, my doctor eventually stopped prescribing them - after 3 1/2 years. I was at a high dose of 4mg Klonopin. Early this year is when my life was turned upside down when my prescription was cut off. I did not think much of it. Until a few days later when my body started shaking and I got violently sick. I did not know what was happening, neither did my wife. I started googling benzo withdrawal and found this subreddit and concluded that it was in fact the klonopin. 6 months later, I am at a lower dose (.5mg). I should feel accomplished. I should feel like I am making progress, but in fact I feel defeated. I am so tired. I am so worn out. I barely sleep and I am anxious all day. I am terrified of the real world. I have zero confidence in myself. I feel like a total loser. I could cry ever single day. I do not know what is wrong with me. If I had known that Id suffer this way due to Klonopin, I would have told the doctor to shove it down his own throat. This has taken my dignity, my will to continue and my confidence for the future. I do not know what to think anymore. So very confused",1

"The guy I (21F) like has been severely depressed for almost two years now. There have been times he completely blocked everyone out of his life. Now he is slowly getting better (meds and lots of therapy) but he is still very much depressed. I am always the one having to text first or arranging a walk for example. And even then he would be like: sorry i am too tired. Or Hmm maybe one day, but rn i simply do not care.Its ok. I understand. Most of the time.But sometimes i breakLast time he was drunk and suddenly started sending me snaps. (he never liked drinking and he is a real nerd. Its nothing like him to drink. Besides it influences his meds). So i got mad. I texted him that he is being childish (which he is) and that i would leave if he kept acting like this, because i do not recognize him anymore (i believe this personality switch is caused by his meds?).He is involved in self-destructive behavior. And his psychiatrist does not really tell him to stop doing stupid shit. His psychiatrist would be like: do whatever you like. So my problem: I am tired. I did many things for him: make a giant surprise box, two selfmade depression journals, drag him to the library with me, gave him summaries of classes, defend him around our friends, take him for walks, kept texting him.But Sometimes i break, and i hurt him. I know it makes him feel worse. Its because sometimes I simply do not understand why he hurts me so much. Why he can never truly say thank you for everything.I want to make an appointment with a therapist myself. To ask what depression really is and what i can do. How i can handle his emotionless state. And what i should not do. And i want to ask the guy i like if he thinks that is a good idea. (He already knows i read books about depression etc).He does not really talk about the way he feels. And tends to act funny all the time. I knw its fake. I even told him that. But for some reason he told me he does not know how to stop it and be himself.I also want to show him this sub.Any opinions about this? Or maybe suggestions? I feel guilty and frustrated all the time. My friends even tell me i am a clown for texting him. I know its not true. But after two years i am doubting myself.Thanks Please help me idk what to do",1

"My parents are on vacation at the moment and its just me and my older sister home.I had my girlfriend over and we had sex, talked and watch a movie. I asked my sister yesterday if she could have slept over and she said no I know it was selfish and wrong of me to still take her home with me but I just wanted 1 day, just 1 day of not feeling terrible of just being myself.I have religious parents and just a religious family in general. I do not believe in anything and accept how they are and what they believe in but they still want me to be a certain way. I still remember when I was 16 years old and told my dad that I liked a girl and my mom and dads response was you do not know what love is and you are not allowed to be with anyone. I feel so fucking different from my family and I know it was selfish of me but yesterday was the one day I felt some resemblance of joy, I am 20 years old and I have been spending my whole life miserable and I have not been allowed to be myself and I just hate who I am because of what my family expects from me. My sister and my girlfriend kind of got into a bit of an argument because of it. I have never felt this way about anyone and yet still I have a hard time pursuing happiness. I have not eaten today and just laid in bed all day.I do not know why I am so different from the rest of my family, we all grew up the same way but I still ended up so different from my siblings and my whole family.Like I said I know it was selfish of me, but I just wanted 1 day of feeling different, 1 day of getting some rest and to just try and be happy instead of miserable. I do not know what is wrong with me and I am even sorry for writing this and venting about it, maybe I do not even deserve it. I did something too make me happy and it only caused pain.

The reason why I want to make this my goal is because growing up, I’ve always been told I was mediocre and dumb by people in my family as well as outsiders. I also see my parents getting older each day and it pains me in my heart to realize that I’m consider a failure in their eyes. So far I have a 97.78% in my Calc class but finals is in 12 days and I know nothing about the last chapter of my calculus class (this current professor does not teach at all compared to my past math professors) so I always just end up watching YouTube videos and asking redditors on the math subreddit. The thing is I’m feeling extreme procrastination at this point and I just want this class to be over because the professor is so terrible. My issue is that I want to maintain an A but since my finals is literally 30% of my grade I am scared that I won’t have an A anymore if I bomb it. Are there any tips y’all can give me to not stress so much and to stop procrastination?",3

"I got a job offer for place that is I feel I completely click with and I rushed to accept. After 2 minutes of excitement, I just went back to feeling nothing again. I will have to move away, upend my life completely, make new friends and meet new people. This should all be really exciting but I just feel completely nothing. Even worse is that I feel so privileged making this post. So many people are in such a worse position and cannot say the same, which just makes me completely awful even complaining in the first place. I am sorry this is a bit rambly but I just had to vent.

"I do not want to move. I have moved a total of 8 times and I am 17. My parents after only being a year here want to move to a mobile home, now that would be my 9th move. Not to count the year I spent living in Mexico. I am not a military kid, its just my family has experienced financial highs and lows. I know I have to move but I do not want to. When our last move came down to three houses I told my parents I wanted this one, as I envisioned it to be my home. A place where I know Ill always have, a place I can always come back to. I know Ill leave for college soon anyways but I do not want to leave after only a year, I wanted this house to be different. You promised me this was it",1

"I might have depression I might not. I fit all the boxes, relate to the stories, but I do not trust myself. I have pulled some crazy crap in the past to try and be cool, and how do I know this is any different? I could just be making this all up. But things are different. I cannot deny that. It just feels like I cannot remember what simple pleasure or joy feels like, its just anger, sadness, and numbness. It feels like the life has been sucked out of me, but I still do not believe myself. As I write this, I come more and more to terms with it, but the next challenge will be seeing if my parents believe me. Generally, I want to vent but do not have the energy. I just need a diagnosis and some way to stabilize myself. I do not even know",1

"University Degree Stress Hello I'm currently in my third year of university. Since the start I have been very stressed and at times had bad thoughts come into my head. I tried to talk to my parents about switching programs or go to university with less expectations (The University I'm going to is known to be brutal to their students). Sadly that didn't work which I understand from my parents side if I get through it then it will pay off. The next two years for me is just going to be quite scary as I'll be doing a Full Time course load in the Fall, Spring and Summer for two years straight. Just ranting I guess and some sort of motivation would be nice honestly.

School for me has always been a stressful topic and has never changed even in high school I'd say I've always been so anxious or stressed about the topic. Though what I can say is that once I do the two years at least I am out and finish my degree and I can move on from the idea of school. Just ranting at this point as this topic has definitely affected me a lot through out the years but this week it has affected me more than ever but I am now coming into terms that with the two year plan I got going it's not going to be that bad forever.",3
So today my mom told me that the family wants me out of the house because of my aggression towards people. I was pretty much made go on anti depressants if i wanted to live with them but I hated myself on them also. The final straw was when my mom and me got into an argument and she told me how my behaviour is embrassing and how i use aggression to cope with my situations is shameful and i told her to just fuck off. I tried going to counselling before and it did not work. I just do not know what to do anymore I think I have officially hit Rock bottem,1
"Scared to start Lexapro I have a crippling anxiety disorder and I’ve been prescribed Lexapro. I have GAD but I’ve noticed my anxiety has always been around my health, especially my heart. It’s gotten so bad that I barely leave the house and I’m afraid to exert myself which is depressing because I used to be a gym rat and exercising was what I used to do help cope with my anxiety but that’s not something I can do anymore, Atleast In my mind I can’t. This has really intensified over this past year after dealing with multiple panic attacks that have landed me in the ER and I’ve been getting  a bunch of physical symptoms constantly that does not help with my worrying. I’ve had many tests done and the doctors are very reassured that I’m healthy. My Doc believes the Lexapro will help me but I can’t seem to find the courage to take it. I’m just so terrified of it, I’d really appreciate some encouragement to start my meds because I high key hate living like this .😭",2

"(God bless.) He was very caring at a first glance, but as the relationship went on I started discovering deeper things about him. Please be understanding that at the time I dated this guy I was around 14 or 15. He got off to IRL gore. You may think, well that's weird, but that's not the abusive part.",0
"I have met this guy, who I thought was the most amazing guy I have met in a long time. We seemed to be really into each other, enjoyed each other company, went on about 4 dates that had me fall for him badly.I have a history of disastrous dating experiences, most people I have seen never even got to the dating stage, it is just how I am, makes people want to distant themselves.I have noticed this time I came on too strong, like I confessed him how much I was into him after a couple dates. My social anxiety makes me shut down my personality when I am with someone I like, because I am scared of being judged. My mind just goes in auto pilot, I blank, I stutter and do not even realise I am being weird until afterwards, thinking I should have been more spontaneous. I think to his eyes I might have appeared like I did not want to deepen our connection, looked uninterested and uninteresting, all because I was not comfortable with myself being around him.Also think that the quality of our dates was not varied enough, which might have quickly killed the interest, we were just hanging out at each others' with no real plan or activity set in place, so that might have made it stale.It kind of died when we agreed to meet up one weekend where he said he would let me know if he was free, then never called and have not heard from him since then.I am so sad and annoyed that I have allowed the fear of being myself in front of him being the reason of him getting bored of me.I have been through a hell of a year, escaping an abusive friendship which has made me miserable for a good part of my days, and is still causing me mental distress. I have only slightly mentioned this to him, without going too much into detail because I did not want to freak him out, just like I have left out many of the issues that I struggle with with my mental health.I cannot see any light, I want to be better, I want to make me happy and be happy with someone, I just never know how much of me it is okay to share with someone. They freak out if I tell them I like them, they freak out if I stay silent, they freak out if I talk about my demons. I know I should talk about what makes me interesting, my dreams, my values and what I believe in, the truth is I do not have enough self esteem to even be able to believe in myself, if I talk about my dreams out loud I would sound unexciting because I have always been the last person to believe in me. it is a lot to ask anyone to put up with such an emotional mess, I know no one is perfect, but I doubt anyone would want to start a relationship if they fear their partner would be problematic to be around. I might have freaked out the guy I thought I would start dating",1

Ok so firstly I should say she hasn't been formally diagnosed but it's at this point a logical conclusion that she's suffering some kind of ptsd from a rape that she endured a couple years back. It was before I knew her and when we met she seemed to be pretty stable. Although I know now that's not the case. I do not blame her at all for this behaviour but I really need help understanding her before I get hurt worse than I already have. Going forward keep in mind 2 things:,0
"I just feel so trapped. So trapped.I try so hard, I really do. Whenever I get a new full time job I am very eager, I work hard. But as the weeks go by, I can feel everything falling apart. I stop exercising, I stop eating well, I am tired all the time.I feel like I expend more energy than normal people. An 8 hour work day completely floors me, even in a non-toxic work environment. I come home feeling spent. I do not have the energy to work on myself. I do not have the energy to run my errands, or manage my house, or keep my appointments. I forget important tasks all the time.Working part time I usually feel better, energy and health wise. But, then I cannot afford to improve myself. I cannot afford the gym, or healthy food, or a nice quiet apartment, or my hobbies. So then I get depressed anyway.I am really scared. I am scared things will not get better. I am scared I will never be able to live a normal, comfortable life. I am scared I will never have the energy or money for my hobbies, or for my loved ones. It makes me want to give up now, before I suffer even more whenever I work full time, I get horribly depressed. But I fear I will never be able to live a comfortable life working part time. I feel like I was born to fail.",1

"I(22M) live with my mother. She has sacrificed a lot for me but she has been very toxic for me(keeps shouting on me and throws things when angry, does not let me have my privacy) which has made me frustrated. I want to move out but I get depressed if I am alone for long, which gets me to the point of being suicidal. I have tried this before so I know where it can get me. So I asked my bf to move in with me but he denied giving some lame reason, and said that we will live together later. He visits me whenever I have a big break down(in a month or so) but I want to have some solution for my situation, I do not want to have big depressive episodes time and again. it is hampering my career. I do not have any friends and even if I tell someone, they just ignore it and say things like: ""do not be depressed, I know it is hard"". Honestly, I feel lifeless now and just want to be away from everyone, since it feels like no one wants to actually help. I do not know what to do in order to uplift my spirits. I break down after every 10-11 days and cannot put up with the toxic environment. Maybe I am wrong to expect things from people. I was hurt the most by my bf's reaction but I know I am wrong to expect since it is a big thing to ask for. Unable to get out of toxic environment.",1
"When I cross the street, I hope that Ill randomly get run over. Or that maybe Ill randomly suffer a heart attack or if I am up somewhere high, I might think Ill jump over the ledge.

Does anyone else have these intrusive thoughts and how do you deal with them? Sometimes I hope Ill randomly die",1

"As an aside, it really kind of messes you up when the DA calls and tells you that in less than a week your abuser will be putting in a final plea; if you'd like to attend, please come for at least half a day to see what will happen. So, talked to my therapist about this and I had already told the DA I want him to see jail time not just 2 years of probation with state mandated drug treatment. isn't this also really awful as now they'll just forever say it was because of their addiction and never take full responsibility for their own actions? I digress, I demanded that he gives me a face to face apology. My therapist thinks it might be a bad idea as it's been less than a year and she thinks he will only lie and tell me he's sorry because I've requested it.",0

"Hey guys, I (M31) have been depressed as long as I can remember, but realized it just 7 years ago. Until then I thought everybody must feel like this and that I was just weak. Since then I was in therapy 3 times. Had panic attacks and 2 burn outs. I feel miserable most of the time and have suicidal thoughts every few weeks. When I started therapy for the first time, I felt really great afterwards and I thought ""Great, that is it. I have the positive thinking in place and can move on with my life."" That was at the end of university. I also met my girlfriend at this time and was as happy as never before in my life.I started with a lot of energy into my first job in a small company and worked my way up from technician to a management position within 2 years.At the end I was under constant tension and my stomach hurt all the time. I thought a raise would give me the motivation to keep on going. But I quit the day after I got a 20% raise, because I realized that I did not feel anything changing in this moment. I went to the doctor, because I felt miserable and he told me, I had a burnout. I was sick for a month and could almost only lie in bed and do nothing else.After this has happened, I started a therapy again for a few months. Fast forward 3 years. I try not to overwork myself, but I am in a constant spiral of being angry, feeling miserable, feeling weak/overworked and wanting to quit whatever I am doing, I often just wish to disappear. My relationship is suffering a lot from this, because I can not see any perspective to lead a normal life, if I keep on breaking down every 6 months.My father had a stroke, a few weeks ago and died after 10 days in the hospital where I visited him every day. When I heard about his stroke, I was worried of course, but at the same time I suddenly had energy, focus and the will to change things in my life. I wanted to learn from his mistakes. This held for a few weeks. A few weeks have passed since the funeral and I feel as miserable as before. It feels strange that I actually felt so good when there was an actual reason to feel bad.Since my last breakdown, I started to mistrust my judgemental skills. This constant rollercoaster of feelings really freaks me out. I want to have children with my girlfriend in a few years, but I am so scared to just not be able to provide for a family or be a bad parent with this condition.I just made an appointment to apply for another therapy, but I actually lost hope that anything is ever going to help. There would be so many more details to tell about that do not fit into this thread.Has anybody actually defeated depression or is it going to be a constant battle for the rest of my life? I am just so tired. I do not know how to go on with my life",1
"It seems like it is impossible to get appointments without getting a private therapist, who are expensive af. Free services like the suicide hotline, forums etc can help but are not long term solutions. Medications can be expensive with or without insurance. It seems like so many people wanting help just get ignored. Then we are blamed for having breakdowns, self harming and suicide. Sucks Why are mental health care services so inaccessible?",1
"A couple of my friends have been having some real good things happen to them lately, and while I want to be happy for them I cannot help but feel jealous. I feel like such an asshole for thinking this but I do not know what to do my life has been in a steady downfall and I do not even know what to do with it anymore. I am so lost and alone and every time I see something good happen for someone it makes me feel worse because I just cannot get a break. I just want to end it already. Jealous of my friends",1

"My depression has made my family hate me. I no longer enjoy doing things with them and they say I am negative all the time. I try I really do try to be positive but its just so hard, nigh on impossible for someone as depressed as I am. I guess I fake it well enough that they think I am well enough. I just feel hopeless and alone. Nothing makes me happy anymore except for my dog and buying stuff for him. But whenever I buy stuff for him or talk about him and how much I love him I get shot down by my family. They want me to be positive about certain things but other things not so much, only if it fits their agenda. They want me to be positive about everything and honestly although I know I am extremely depressed and borderline suicidal, I do not think that being positive all the time is a healthy mindset either. I just do not know how to impress them anymore. I do not want to be super fake all the time because its exhausting and annoying but I have tried my best to be positive and they cannot handle that either. I hate to disappoint them but I am driving them all crazy. Maybe its time to end it all and make them stop being annoyed with me. Family just cannot understand my pain",1

I am really struggling today. I live alone I am old 37 F and have no kids no husband no family I am really close with. .. I have few friends and I feel like I have no reason to live. The place I live is a resort destination so people come here to celebrate holidays with their family. Its incredibly painful for me. It makes me feel worse than I would otherwise. The 4th of July in America is a big holiday for many. At one time it was for me too. Now I am just lonely and overweight and have no job or prospects of a relationship. I have no one to take care of me when I am old. I have no money saved. No credit. I have huge student loan debt. My life is too worthless to maintain. The bad is outweighing the good. I cannot pull myself out as easily this time it feels pointless. I suffer with PTSD and have flashbacks and nightmares. I wake up in the morning having suffered through a whole night of torture and it makes me days worse. I think back on the dreams throughout the day. I cannot work. I cannot be around people. I can barely leave my house for any reason. My dog is depressed. I feel worse because of that too. Its just piles of awful. When I was younger I was more resilient. I could see hope in my future. I could go through the bad and still have hope. I cannot do it anymore. I lost the love of my life because of the way I am in 2014 and I think about him still daily. He is married and had at least one kid. I know where they spend these holidays together with his family happy. I wish that was my life. I miss him terribly even still. I hate my life. I hate my life. I just want all this to end. I just want to feel numb or nothing . These holidays make me want to not be alive anymore.,1

"It just hurts. To live, it hurts. To remind of all the good things I have lost and will never come back to me.I have been abandoned by the person I held the closest to my heart, and I cannot see any other reason to keep on fighting this disgusting life I am left with. Things will never get better: only worse. There is just way too much going downhill in my existence, and I do not have the strength to make a change or kickstart my life from the miserable, broken condition I am in now. I am trying. I am fucking trying. I have never spent so much time talking to other people, trying as hard as I can to keep my mind occupied. I am speaking with a therapist, but nothing's helping me to get over this. I am not even sure if I WANT to get over this.And when I am alone, in the darkness of my bedroom, memories keep hammering me over and over with many contrasting feelings. Nostalgia, remorse, hatred, want, frustration, love.Love.I know it is serious when I constantly keep thinking about how much would it hurt to slice my wrists open. Or when I constantly feel like writing one last message, for every person that I loved.I am not sure I can endure this. I just woke up crying and thought about ending myself.",1

"The summer before 8th grade is when the symptoms started hitting. I have always been a fairly airheaded, chatty, upbeat person on the surface. Actual anger, discomfort, or sadness are things that i just do not express. I sorta just sat at the corner of friend groups and never shared my deep thoughts...that is to say, i was sorta just someone to have casual friendly conversation with. I am often left out of things that my circles do, only to find about how much fun they had when they chat endlessly to me about it.Due to a lot of factors, I essentially just had a mental collapse at the end of the summer and the start of 8th grade. I would put on my happy facade at school and then go home and quietly cry or just zone out. I started self-harming at that time too, and i made sure to do it in places that were easy to hide.I was also pretty aware of how people romanticize depression or fake it, and i used to obsessively tell myself that I was faking it. That the self-harming was for attention even though i desperately hid it. I felt like others would think the same about me if i told them, and that terrified me.I eventually started to accept that the symptoms that i was experiencing were real around August of 2020, a full year after shit hit the fan, and around November, i started to have really intense suicidal thoughts. My grades slipped. I went from being high functioning to laying in bed all day feeling like there was nothing to live for. My parents would only berate me for my slipping grades, which made me feel like i could not tell anyone even more. I made a full plan to finally do it, and tested out my chosen method. I started writing suicide notes in my head. And i had no friends to turn to because none of them knew, and i did not want to inconvenience them with my stupid emotions.I finally reached out to my doctor as a last-ditch effort at the start of this year, and when she told my parents, it only caused my mom to temporarily pity me and my dad to get angry...and then they acted like it never happened. I do not think I will do that again lolI psych myself out sometimes because i hit these lengths where I feel somewhat average. Not exactly happy or content, but i do not feel like dying 24/7 and my immediately reaction to everything is not an intense urge to off myself (oh god that sounds so edgy but my knee-jerk reaction literally just becomes ""fucking do it"" whenever i feel like I have messed up) so then I tell myself that there is no reason to tell anyone anymore. Inevitably I always fall back into the same dark space but oh well.I just cannot reach out or tell my friends because I do not want to bring anyone down. If i have any true goal in life that will give me any peace, its to make people as happy and content as possible. If people find out, I feel like I will just drag everyone down. I am always the upbeat one in groups, the one that people laugh at because i do stupid shit, but I feel like that whole act will be ruined. Nobody will want to be around meIts been 2 years and almost nobody knows...and nobody probably will ever know. I have basically accepted that I will eventually recover alone or kill myself before i do.I am sorry that this is probably super melodramatic. Its been 2 years and almost nobody knows",1

The change of tone and basically being accused of lying instantly brought tears to my eyes that I struggled to hold back. My body went instantly into this panicked mode, my breath quickened, my hands shook and my heart felt like it was being stabbed in multiple directions. I tensed up like I was expecting to be hit, even though my current bf has never done anything twords me in any harmful way, my body reacted this conditioned response....I could not bring myself to say anything at the time and shortly after he said he was tired and went to bed.

"Anxiety Symptoms I'm new to this Reddit thing but I have been reading posts in this subreddit for a couple of weeks now and I thought I would post about my anxiety symptoms. I am recently struggling with the thought that this really is anxiety, my biggest fear is of course the big C-word, lymphoma for example. Everything started in November about 4 months ago, on vacation in Vietnam. I experienced what I think was my first panic attack with heart palpitations, pressure on chest, difficulty to breath etc. Since then, I have experienced so many different symptoms and sensations such as lump in throat, feeling of not getting enough air, difficulty to breath, waking up several times every night (sometimes with a strange feeling of fear), lately my skin feels like its burning or is sensitive, it also sometimes feels like my heart flutters, skips a beat or is just pounding out of my chest but not a fast heartbeat just very hard and powerful. I also experience headaches like never before, extremely cold feet pretty much all the time. Man, I've probably missed a few sensations too but this is really getting to me. I've had EKG, echo, blood work done to test my thyroid etc and all came back clear. I'm thinking about how I feel all the time and I am noticing every little sensation in my body and the smallest thing can set me off into almost panic for a few seconds. Lately its been more of pressure on my chest and difficult to breath thats been the worst symptom. On top of this, I had a cold for about three weeks ago and I felt a lymph node that was swollen, this set my health anxiety off into a frenzy and I can't stop thinking about it ever since. I can still feel the lymph node ( I'm touching it all the freaking time hoping its gone, knowing that I shouldn't) and my doctor said it was nothing to worry about, but as you know, health anxiety finds its way back no matter what. Sorry for all this rambling but this is really affecting my life. Do you guys have similar or the same symptoms? How do you cope or how did you overcome this son of a b\*tch anxiety?",2

When you already have a PD diagnosis, or a hypochondria diagnosis, I find that doctors don't take you seriously. I completely understand why they wouldn't: it's tiresome for them when you come in and tell them you're having a heart attack when you're really suffering from GERD. When I first saw a doctor and told her that it felt like I'd broken my rib three times in one year, she sent me to a psychiatrist. The next doctor told me I needed to up my Prozac. Finally, a CT scan showed I have a severe Fibrous Dysplasia tumor in my 10th rib which is growing into my liver, kidney, and diaphragm. I'm scheduled for surgery on March 5th. 

It's hard to know when it's your health anxiety and when it's your health, and GOOD LORD it's tiring for us anxious people to convince doctors that we're having a real problem. I honestly still don't know how to tell the difference, but I'm here to say, SOMETIMES, your gut is right.

Anyone else have trouble with doctors writing them off because of their Anxiety or Hypochondria?",2

Thing is, I cannot even feel sadness. My friend told me how she nearly drowned 2 times last week, and I did not feel anything. I cannot take it anymore. Its been more than 2 years. I was 19 when I first got it. Now I am 22. I had to drop out of med school (which was 95% of my life), wanted or not lost touch with most of people there, I loved taking photos, now its a chore. I have tried MANY antidepressants but from what I found out ssris/snris even make people without this issue numb. I have no desires, hopes, dreams, goals and man, did I have lots of them. I am going to therapy but I do not believe it will work. I have forgotten so much what is it like to feel good, I do not even miss it anymore. How can I miss something I do not even remember. I am also apathetic and do not feel like I want to get better. I take ads and do therapy just in case.

"Constant feeling that I'm doing something wrong. There is a persistent feeling of uneasiness and insecurity that permeates so many of my actions. I feel like somehow, unconsciously, I'm sabotaging my own future. Academically, socially, romantically, it feels like I'm constantly out of the loop on some essential piece of information that's going to come back and bite me in the future and ruin any chances of living a comfortable life. All I really want is to be modestly happy and to have the space to enjoy the few things that make me feel that life is worth living (family, love, reading, cooking, hiking, etc). But there is this never ending feeling of insecurity that I'll never achieve this. I know there are no guarantees and that our future is really out of our hands, but it just gets me down so much knowing that there's a possibility I'll be alone in the future or I'll end up too poor to engage in my passions, or that my life will become an endless stream of meaningless labour and bills, or that I'll reach a point where my opportunities in life have irrevocably passed and I'm trapped in a depressive, meagre existence forever. Probably sounds dramatic, but I just can't help this way of thinking, I always feel like there's something better I could be doing, some area of my life that needs to be optimised, some chain of decisions that once met will lead me to the best possible outcome. At the end of it all it just makes me want to withdraw and give up because of all the pressure.",1

"I find it so frustrating as a highly anxious and depressed person to do career tests because they rely on your passion for specific activities and I find myself answering ""I dislike it very much"" to the various questions (e.g,. working in construction, healthcare, finance, whatever). I've been trying to get back to work again because it seems my severe depression and anxiety won't go away and there is only so much medication and therapy can help me. Of course, I haven't tried every kind of therapy but what had been offered to me at low cost. But I've tried many medications.

Anyhow, I feel very frustrated because after trying couple of online part time jobs (like writing marketing stuff on websites) and finding myself not motivated enough to work sufficient hours to make ends meet, I'm trying to start from zero again and do some career tests to find what motivates me. But those tests don't offer some magical information but just rely on what you're passionate about. Like they give you 50 questions and ask you how much you like doing different activities, like installing cabinets, diagnosing disease in people, giving financial advice to someone wanting to get a loan, helping a disabled person get dressed, playing a musical instrument in front of an audience, taking care of sick animals, etc etc etc.

I hate them ALL! None of these activities excite me. Because having a job is always about what others expect of you. But mental illness sucks so much of your energy that there is so little left for the job.

Like if I'm a cashier, my high anxiety and depression and the various thoughts and emotions and physical symptoms I experience will take so much of my energy to control and nothing left to put on a smile and make a customer feel welcome and at the same time do my job of scanning items very quickly and correctly.

That's why I've been trying to find jobs that are just online and things I can do on my own time, so that whenever the damned mental health issues give me a break then I can do the job. The problem is there are too many people doing these jobs and they pay so little that I've had to start looking at other options.

Damn it, I don't know what I want to hear from you, to be honest, I mean I already am so filled with self-hatred and hatred for the world, I am working myself into anger just writing about it.",2

"Apologies in advance if this post is long, Ill try to have all the detail in as few words as I can.Quick background: I am about to be a junior in college, good home life, a lot of friends, very intelligent, plenty of struggles with anxiety but never anything too extreme.In September of 2020, I suffered a head injury playing pickup football with some friends. It did not feel serious at all and I was back in the game a few minutes later. The symptoms did not kick in for about 10 days.In hindsight, it was probably a mild concussion and nothing too major. However, I had no idea what I was dealing with, so I treated it probably exactly how you should not treat it. I worried about it constantly and pushed myself with school, partying, etc. there is not a lot of wiggle room when it comes to slowing down in the college life so I just continued to try to push on, which ended up being a bad idea. I was up and down with symptoms for about 6-7 weeks during this time.In late November, I suddenly crashed and everything went to shit again. All of the sudden in the course of a day I became totally dissociated and my brain fog increased tremendously. I thought it was nothing more than a symptom flair at first, but eight months later I still deal with these symptoms 24/7, and they have destroyed my life.I have done everything, seen all the doctors I thought would help, and nothing has given me any relief. I have been constantly dissociated since that time and my brain functions at a fraction of the capacity it used to. It makes life fucking terrible to live. I can still try and do things I did before, but I can never enjoy anything due to the way I constantly feel. My motivation is pretty much gone. Driving feels like a life risking activity every time I do it. School was next to impossible last semester and I am no better for this one coming up. My sleep has been horrendous since the injury and I was also recently diagnosed with Celiac disease (which I only found out thanks to the injury, so that is cool ig)The silver lining is that I think the problem here is that all the worry and anxiety has been trapped in my brain and the trauma surrounding the worrying is the issue rather than actual brain damage. I was not officially diagnosed with depression but one doctor thought that is what could be prolonging my issues. Even with this knowledge I cannot find any relief whatsoever. I really struggle to tell people this: first because its very personal, second because I struggle to share my feelings, and third because I have always been a guy to light up the room and now I have to act because I do not want to bring peoples moods down when they are around me. The people in my life know I am dealing with this but nobody knows the level of suffering I deal with mentally on a daily basis and I find it really hard to be honest about. I feel like my future is totally in jeopardy and I am very hopeless right now. I wanted to get this off my chest anonymously.",1

Its just a bunch of static lines that will not go away and its very lonely. When people talk to me it feels like a ton of tiny serrated needles sneaking into my brain. It takes a longer for me to understand, like I have a delay, or glitch. I do not enjoy anything. Nothing. None of the things I love bring me joy. I would much rather lay in bed or on the couch all day and not have a single interaction. I can barely make myself take a shower. I have had two since Friday, and its sad that that is an accomplishment. Its Tuesday. I hate everything. I hate my life. I just want to be better for my daughter. This is hard, and I do not want it to be hard anymore. I WANT to smile. I WANT to enjoy a lunch break with my husband. I WANT to wake up happy. I WANT to enjoy being outside.

Health Anxiety and Xanax My health anxiety involves fear of having a heart attack or stroke. Ive been to the Emergency Rooms more times that I can count thinking im dying. I went to a psychiatrist and he prescribed me Zoloft daily and Xanax (.5 mg) to take only in emergencies. Ive been taking the Zoloft for the past week and a half noticing no improvement but ive heard it takes a while for it to actually kick in. I still haven't taken any of the Xanax and it makes me anxious to think about the side effects and hearing stories of people getting addicted to it/dying from it. Anyone have any good experiences with it? I would hate for it to make my panic attacks worse.

IF YOU EVER DO THAT AGAIN, you will FUCKEN SEE WHAT HAPPENS"".Since i was a child he is been training me everyday since i was a kid id go to wwork with him, untill i started school. Then it was jist the summmers. And then it was weekends and summers by the time i was 12. I jad become severely overweight and only haad 2 physically and emotionally abusive friends. By the time i was 14, i was essentially running one of the buisnesses myself. Yet he acts like i have all this fucken free time to do everything he needs when I am trying to have my own life. He goes, ""you can do whatever you want"" but then also forces me to work under him, and underpays me when he finally made me become an employee since we were lacking manpower at the time.

"food and hair pulling How on earth do I stop utilizing food for comfort? This past year is the first time I've had a very unhealthy relationship with food (had my second child and have been nursing her. I'm a sahm with a 3 and 1 year old). All I can think about is food and eating. I'm constantly ""snacking"" and I'm always eating really bad and unhealthy options. I sometimes get healthier options but something in my brain just won't go for those in the moment and I truly feel I can't control it(I know I can and should be able to but I guess my willpower sucks). I'm so sick of starting and restarting  my health journey every day because I can't keep from overeating to an insane level. It's truly becoming embarrassing and I have so much shame.

I also have issues with hair pulling. I'll sit and pull my hair out one strand at a time anytime I'm idle. I'm well into it before I even realize how long I've done it. I've had this issue on and off since college.

I’ve dated a lot over the past few years, but this is the first time in ages where I’ve REALLY been into the person.

Constant thoughts of whether or not she likes me, obsessing over every word in her texts to try interpreting meaning, freaking out if she’s doesn’t respond to my messages within a couple hours. It’s taking over my life. My work is slipping, I can’t sleep well, a constant awful sick panicked feeling in the pit of my stomach. 

It doesn’t help that she’s very reticent with her emotions and does not offer much words of affection or validation. But I don’t want to scare her off with my intense feelings so on the surface I’ve been playing it cool the best I can.

I do not know where to start, do you know that feeling you have when you are super attached to a person and everything she/he does affects your mood? Well, I am there. I am fearing for her/him to abandon me, we are just friends but I am not sure when this happened, I just cannot be happy if we are in a bad spot on our relationship. And most of the times there is no ""bad spot"", it is just me destroying myself after over-thinking about a posts, or a bad response from him/her etc. The worst part of this is that the most important person in my life does not really have that same feeling for me. I know I am important to her/him, but not the same way, and it fucking hurts, I do not KNOW WHY. And I cannot make it stop. My life is nothing without him/her, and I am ashamed of myself for that, it is just ridiculous. I am even trying to change my body because maybe he/she will like me more.

"Booked a health test - total regression Hi,
I've experienced health anxiety on and off for most of my life. It has become a lot better over the years and I have found ways to cope and calm myself down. I'm not the HA-type that goes to doctors a lot - actually almost never - partly because my ""rational"" part knows that it's just HA and partly because it's so crazy expensive. My main tools for managing HA has been ""act normal"" (even if I feel worried and obsess, do not take action - don't look for reassurance, don't see a doctor, don't google - don't feed the monster), setting a specific time when it's ok to worry (""between 6-7 at night, worry time. At other times, just postpone it."") and writing down what I worry about. It's been going well for the last few years and I almost considered myself ""cured"".
Until I decided to go for an extensive health check with a battery of tests. There's no particular symptom that brought on this, just that it's something I should start doing regularly at my age. What normal people do. However, as soon as I booked the test and got the list of tests, HA totally exploded. In a way worse than the usual HA where I used to focus on just a few illnesses - now I basically convinced that with that many tests and possible cancers, I must check positive for at least one! Has anyone else experience this kind of setback and how did you cope? I still have two-three more weeks before the results.",2

"Does Studying Trigger Extreme Anxiety? I have this real weird thing that happens to me.

So besides my work life, I have potential academic plans. I love studying, reading, writing. I have so many ambitions with all these things I want to write. I might even publish them. I spend a lot of time-effort on these studies I do on my personal life.

The weird thing is, whenever I go into focused studying, the idea that I will die anyways comes to my mind. I start to feel like this effort is for nothing, that I will die eventually, maybe even soon. I read about these scholars of the past, and see that some of them died so young. What will all this information help me with if I am going to die anyways? Will I have enough time to categorize-interpret-publish so much knowledge?

Anyways, lots of anxious thoughts suddenly rush to my mind about mortality. I had this back in uni as well. I remember when I studied a lot during my masters, I would always start thinking about my mortality and whether all the work I do is even worth it....

Is there a scientific explanation to this? Why would studying in a focused manner put me in such an  existential crisis each time?

"Very sudden onset of physical anxiety symptoms? Hi all,

I never struggled with anxiety like this before, when suddenly I had a panic attack for the first time last month - I felt suddenly extremely uncomfortable and ""trapped/unsafe"" in the minutes leading up to it but the whole time I was still thinking rationally. But the physical symptoms were definitely there and since then I've been having these mini bouts of extremely rapid hyperventilation just randomly through the day and tightness/pain in the chest/stomach. 

These originally happened whenever I thought any remotely negative thought at all, but now they're just popping up at random times. Currently I'm sat here with my stomach in knots and feeling like I'm about to cry for absolutely no reason at all. I wouldn't say I'm very worried about anything in particular (just the normal things I've been a little stressed about my whole life, like school) but it's getting really annoying to have these small (or on occasion, full-blown) anxiety attacks nearly every day. 

Again, this is all completely new to me. I'm prone to overstressing or worrying at times but these symptoms don't seem to be completely related to that since they come on so randomly and I feel like they would have popped up sooner during more stressful times in my life? If anyone has any insight it would be much appreciated, because it's getting really freaking annoying and interfering with my schoolwork and personal relationships. At this point would something like therapy even help me if it's so primarily physical? What do I do??? Thank you!",2

"Was this sexual abuse? I’m (F25) not sure how to write this. I’ve never put down my memories to paper let alone tell anyone. A family member would do certain things between (from what little I can remember) the ages of 7-15. These things made me feel uncomfortable and I asked multiple times for it to stop to no avail. I want to protect their identity so calling them X.

1. X never let me lock the bathroom door when I shower X walks right in and has conversations with me even though the shower doors are see-through. This still happens now at 25yo. I used to lock the door when I was younger but X would use a coin to open the door and would leave it wide open so I just stoped locking the door and forget to every time now. 

2. X have always sneaked up the stairs and burst into my room on purpose. Dispute multiple times asking X to knock. If I’m just out a shower and wearing a towel I’ll always ask X to leave but X scoffs as if I should be less embarrassed and I’m weak for being embarrassed about being naked. 

3. When I was younger if I would touch myself X would take enjoyment from bursting into my room and surprising me and made me feel dirty and mentally fucked up for doing so. X would also watch through a crack in the door (caught them sometimes) before bursting in. 

4. X would ask to see my breasts and say it was to compare mine to theirs and any time I said I didn’t want to I was made to feel silly for being embarrassed like it was no big deal. 

5. X used to ask me to shower with them. Well over the age I needed anyone to wash my hair. Still asking me at 15. X would again scoff if I said no and plead for me to join them as if I was not wanting quality time with them. 

6. X flashes me (still does) and leaves the door to the bathroom wide open when they shower and sometimes calls me over to chat with them on purpose as if they want to see my reaction to seeing them naked. 

7. X would insist on checking me ‘down there’ when I was younger and would put cream on me saying there was a rash but I never saw one. I remember getting older and being adamant that I could do it myself but X got furious with me. 

8. X gets into my bed without asking when I’m in bed or when I’m not and asks me to cuddle them in their bed and gets angry when I say no. 


The next two are hard for me to type…I don’t feel ready but this platform has been really supportive so far so here goes. For content X definitely physically abused me and still emotionally abuses me and I think they are narcissistic.  


9. Growing up and even sometimes now I go into a childlike mind and put on a higher pitched child like voice (this cringes me so much so please don’t say anything nasty about this). Once when I was around 16 I was hugging X in their bed and was in this childlike state. They played into it and said ‘aww my baby, do you want to suck milk’ and I for some disgusting reason that bothers me to this day I nodded and X got their breasts out and I ….I can’t type the rest but I don’t think I need to.

10. Again difficult to put down to writing. This one I don’t know if it’s in my head. When I was younger X would ask me to sit on their lap. I would feel (or think I did) them pushing up their private part on my body. I would feel uncomfortable and would sit in a different position but it would keep happening and I learnt to ignore it. 

Sorry for the left hoy post but because this is not obvious or classic case of sexual abuse (I think) I’m just unsure if it was. I know this person would take it very badly if they knew I was thinking this and I feel like I’m betraying that persons honour or something. 

(Context : been depressed since 11/12  and after experiencing panic attacks for the first time at 25 I finally told a doctor and I’m on a waiting list to get help for pdsd (unsure if that’s what I have) and I don’t know if it’s worth mentioning this if it’s stupid or a lie or if I am even able to). I also struggle to enjoy sex unless it’s bdsm I’m not sure if that’s related but I just feel dirty if I am wanting it.",2

"Yes I am probably crazy but read if you would like. Maybe I am not crazy whatsoever, maybe the intelligent man simply sounds like an insane man to the less intelligent. Who knows. If a society wanted to put a cap on the capabilities of its inhabitants, it could hypothetically be entirely possible with psychological barriers. Say a society wants to ensure that nobody gets too smart, or enlightened for the liking of the simulation, a swift dose of nihilism could put a stop to the inhibitions of the intelligent in order to ensure that they will not destroy the simulation. A perfect citizen is ignorant, therefore they can slave their life away to the world as they know it, rather than asking questions about that world. If somebody becomes too enlightened, they will not have the desire to slave away for the machine the way they know it to be, rather they would attempt to dissect the irregularities and analysis regarding their existence. As its commonly said, ignorance is bliss, and if you are ignorantly blissful you are not posing a threat to the simulation.What if depression was able to be weaponized in some sort of manner. Instilling a hopeless state of despair into those who pose a threat to a society would ensure that they would not hold motivation to genuinely embark on anything seriously threatfull towards the norms of the machine. It is insanely implausible, but entirely possible, that the simulation we exist in utilizes depression and nihilism as psychological maneuvers to maintain a functional society. If you want to put a stop to the inhibitions of any threat, simply red pill them. Once they reach the nihilistic realizations of reality, they will likely shut down.

"So some back story, my sister has always been my best friend. We have both struggled with mental health our whole lives and while I am starting to balance out she seems to keep getting worse and worse. We had been loving together with me supporting her with maintaining the household cleaning and it exhausted me. I got to the point where I no longer see her as my friend and it hurts.... I am at a loss with her, she does not seem to want to get to get better, will not take responsibility for the stressors she puts on herself, ex. She wants to emotional spend and then cannot afford bills and needs help. The most recent thing happened was she is not a clean person, and she never has been. I moved out of the house and across the state. I recently went back and walked into what can only be described as a pre hoarders situation. I fed her cats and one did not come down. I was genuinely concerned it might have died in the mess. I finally broke down and sent a picture of her bedroom to my mom. I finally told her that I failed her and could not keep up with my sister. I did not how else to help her. My dad reached out and apparently told her to either clean up or move out.(The house was owned by my parents and I was taking care of it for them while they were out of the country.) I went back this weekend and her room looked a ton better. My sister however told me if I ever tattled again then she would go no contact. I respect her decision but how do I show her that being supportive is not always coddling? That I want her to get better but I am at a loss for it. I have tried helping her clean, suggesting different coping methods and she always replies that she is too depressed to do anything about it. I just feel like she is perpetuating her own condition and it is breaking my heart. I am one step away from going no contact because it is hurting me so much. I know that this would not be the answer because of her health. I just feel like such a failure. I am about to lose my sister",1

"Worried about possible Petechiae So for the past few weeks I’ve been having these tiny, pinprick-sized red or sometimes brown dots appear on my skin. Of course the anxious side of my brain has decided that I’m dying of leukemia or some other cancer, even though I have no other symptoms that point towards it. 

What’s especially odd is that these spots appear in certain areas and then go away after a few days. The first time they appeared was on my right hand and arm after I spent the night with my girlfriend. After about two days they went away. Now there’s some of these little spots on my right foot and ankle, and seemingly nowhere else on my body. Anyone else have something like this occur?

My parents, siblings, friends, parents friends etc. Everyone seems to think that i am smart. but i have almost all my life been a very observant person and so i came up to the conclusion that my mental ability does not stand out from people in my life at all. school mostly bore me and so my grades are pretty mediocre, i have an iq of 110 which is not bad but is not either what people would consider a smart person. but yet, people seem to talk about me as if i were some genius. and i know this post may seem like bragging, its really not. the problem here is that i do not live up to the expections people have of me, i am living in a false bubble of being smart when I am not. and whenever people refer to me as intelligent it feels like a punch straight to my gut as i deep down know I am not. this situation may seem like a small problem, and i know that some people have it far worse than me. but i cannot stop thinking of myself as a pathetic human being that always have fed into this lies of being smart. and its not helping either that all i want is to be intellegent. all i want with my life is to make a difference for other people. but looking at people who have taken the world to where it is now they all share one thing, and that is superior intelligence. the thing i lack and the thing i hate about me the most. i do not know what to do, this whole thing really has taken a hit on my mental and i do not know how to accept it and move on with life. every day seems to be another day marching towards my inevitable death knowing that i do not have what it takes to be remembered by people. in a couple hundred years i will problably be forgotten as some ordinary dude. which is not the type of person i want to be remembered as. I am not smart but people tell me i am",1

"Spent an childhood being yelled at to grow up, and now Am i grown up? And if I am is everyday just suffering? Is my life meant to be Wake up, work, go home, sleep, realize you will not have enough time or money for anything. At least childhood had blissful ignorance and no responsibilities. Like Fuck. So, is being an adult just actually constant nonstop pain?",1
"Hello, I'm 22, female and from the UK. I'm kind of freaking out right now because I think something happened to me as a child. I don't even know, I'm sorry I wish I had something concrete to say but I don't think I could even type it out. The problem is I've recently moved to Japan on my own and have no one to talk to here. I would normally talk to my boyfriend but he's not awake and I don't even know what I'd say to him - I don't even feel like I can say anything out loud even if I was with him.",3

"I live in a high end building and I feel if I were to talk to the people who work in the office they wouldn’t take my name off the lease, that they wouldn’t care. I have told a couples therapist and my individual therapist the things he has done in the past, and what he says to me and his actions. I believe they would vouch for me. I also think if I were to say to the office people that I would like to leave before a real scene is made (cops being called, screaming, damage, etc) that they will be more inclined to take my name off lease. Thoughts?",3

"I have some tainted memories with my dad and have doubts about my grandpa. Anyway I don't control when some of these memories and questions pop up. I feel really bad about myself when it happens, sometimes I cry and other times I just have rage. I don't feel like I can talk about it with anyone. I could really use some advice on how to deal with these memories and emotions when they take over, or if any of you have found ways to stop memories from popping up?",3
"It's getting bad again Weird how spring is approaching quickly, yet I can feel the darkness coming again. In the mornings, I wake up as late as possible, so I can spend the early hours in my bed, either unconscious or dreaming, without pain-- without the burden of reality.

The rest of the day I spend in a haze of hating myself, escaping reality through videogames, and starving myself. Losing weight makes me feel good again: I deserve the feeling of an empty stomach, and at the same time, restricting my calories is the only thing that I can control in my life. 

These days, I'm very forgetful, too. I forget appointments and run late for the very few things I have left in my life. My family gets angry at me a lot, to them I am a nuisance. They don't understand why I am slacking. They don't know that I hate being alive, and their anger makes me want to end my consciousness even more.

The evenings are the worst, though, because they are filled with regrets. I'm wasting time. I'm ruining my 20s. I'm isolating myself from the world and soon I won't have anyone left. But I cannot change. I'm powerless against the sadness. It doesn't feel like spring.",1
i have anxiety and possibly depression too but i just wanted to ask if grief can be considered a depression i m not really capable of feeling grief i have only felt it in dream or about animal or something,1

"I began experiencing ""anxiety attacks"" around 2 weeks ago, and have had 3 since, with the latest one being last night. So the first time I was at the dining hall and all of a sudden all the voices around me began to seem echoey and I had a spike of that warm panicky feeling in my body. I quickly got up to put my plate on the dumbwaiter and left the dining hall and it subsided fairly quickly, I didn't really think much of it. The second time was the following Saturday, where when I got back to my dorm I experienced discomfort/malaise from seemingly nothing, no triggers, nothing, just feeling uncomfortable and anxious. This laster for around 30 minutes.",3

"I have been panicking and freaking out for the whole week because I have been feeling like the world is moving on without me. Of course, my depression only has one idea of a solution and that is killing myself. I know there are solutions beyond this, but I feel so helpless and lacking control lately and I do not know what to do. I go through periods of time where I get depressed and feel hollow, and I am going through one right now, and I wish it would be my last, dead or alive. The world is moving on without me",1
"I can't deal with this anymore My anxiety has gotten really bad lately. It has gotten to the point where I'm getting anxiety attacks almost everyday now and I don't know how to make it stop. I can't stop worrying and overthinking. My brain won't shut up. It has been keeping me up at night and I wake up every morning feeling anxious. I've tried meditation, exercising, yoga and I even cut caffeine out of my diet but nothing has worked. I feel so exhausted and defeated. I don't think I can cope with this much longer. I feel like I'm on the verge of having a mental breakdown.",2
"I cannot understand any of my emotions like sadness, when I am asked why are you sad I cannot explain it to that person, but how can I when I cannot even understand it myself ?. Problems with understanding emotions. Does therapy work anyone?",1
"I realize I am in a level of depression where I am fine, until I start thinking. I have to be constantly distracted. Cohabitation (with certain people) and internet help, but I am so deep in it I have to push away the thoughts that are real. Thoughts of grief, thoughts of trauma, fear of the futures in which I am not sure if I will be able to afford to live. I do not have the money to get help or get back on my medications. Legally, I am homeless at the moment, which is something that unfortunately is not a new thought. I cannot help but feel like things will not get better, but worse. How can I succeed if I am depressed? How can I make money if I do not succeed? Why try to fight what time has shown me I cannot? Broke and depressed",1
